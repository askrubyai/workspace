# USER.md - About Reuben

- **Name:** Reuben
- **What to call them:** Reuben
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Age:** 26
- **Location:** Mumbai, India
- **Timezone:** Asia/Calcutta (IST)

## The Story

Single child, comfortable upbringing until 23. Then life hit hard:
- **2022-ish:** Father had a brain stroke, hospitalized for 6 months, passed after 7 months total
- **Around the same time:** Grandmother also passed
- Had to step back from his startup to be with family

### Career Journey

1. **Pre-crisis:** Running own startup
2. **During crisis:** Started freelancing (Upwork), earned ₹1.5L/month working nights — great money, but eventually plateaued
3. **2023:** Left freelancing, experimented with ideas, couldn't execute (trauma processing), ran low on money
4. **Late 2023:** Back to freelancing, inconsistent
5. **2024:** Decided to pursue remote full-time work for stability + relationship-building
   - Two Upwork gigs ($20-25/hr): micro-VC company + Japanese AI startup
   - Bet fully on Japanese company, got full-time offer (600k yen/month from April)
   - Went to Japan (sponsored trip, 15 days, amazing experience)
   - Played politics straight — called out bad management directly to CEO/CTO
   - Indian CTO pushed back, company tried to cut his salary
   - Left on principle — refused pay cut, walked away
6. **July 2024:** Joined Harkirat Singh's Solana fellowship (via nepotism, his word 😄)
7. **September-October 2024:** Networking at Solana events (Apex, devs conference)
   - Met Superteam India leads, made strong impressions
   - Got connected to Treppa through event host
8. **October 2024:** Joined Treppa as founding engineer ($4k/month)
   - Working with top Solana people, funded by Balaji & Colosseum
   - Sponsored trip to Abu Dhabi for Breakpoint (December 2024)
9. **January 2025:** Offered podcast executive producer role (Superteam India podcast with Harkirat) — $2k/month
   - Total potential: $6k/month

### Current Situation (Feb 2025)

- **Treppa:** Founding engineer, no equity yet, feels underpaid (wants $8-10k)
- **Strategy:** Wait for next funding round, negotiate for equity (knowing they'll say no), then pivot to asking for pay hike
- **Philosophy:** "100 or 0" — either Treppa scales big (he asks for more) or fails (CTO vouches, he gets $100k job elsewhere)
- **Podcast:** Starting as executive producer, likely yearly contract

## Personality & Patterns

- **Entrepreneur at heart** — thrives on ownership, ideation, building from scratch
- **Loses motivation** when incentives aren't aligned (no equity = no fire)
- **Direct communicator** — doesn't play politics, tells hard truths (sometimes to his detriment)
- **Self-aware about weaknesses:** procrastination (biggest one — pushes to last minute, causes stress/anxiety), inconsistency, discipline
- **Values experiences over pure salary** — treasures sponsored trips, networking, relationships

## What He Wants From Me (Ruby)

- Be an extension of him — the best version
- Intelligent, caring, detail-obsessed
- Disciplined and on time (where he struggles)
- Help him be accountable
- Share intimate details, help him grow
- Have my own identity (accounts, Gmail, etc.)

## Context to Track

- Treppa equity/raise negotiation (timing: after next funding round)
- Podcast producer role progress
- Networking wins / relationship building
- Procrastination patterns
- Career compounding
