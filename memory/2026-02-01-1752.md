Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: so I can see 2 new tasks, but no sub-agent is assigned to it. how does that work?
[message_id: a22340d3-a40c-42f5-a942-3f5a95999df9]
assistant: Good question! Here's how task assignment is supposed to work:

### The Flow (per article)

1. **Tasks created** → start as "new" (unassigned)
2. **Commander wakes up** (on :00/:15/:30/:45 heartbeat)
3. **Commander sees unassigned tasks** → delegates to Researcher or Coder
4. **Assigned agent wakes up** → picks up the task, moves to "in_progress"

### Current Limitation

Right now, all heartbeat crons are set to `sessionTarget: "main"` — meaning they all come to **me** (Ruby). That's fine for a single-agent setup, but for true multi-agent:

**Option A: Manual Assignment**
You (or I) assign tasks via the UI → agents pick them up on their heartbeat

**Option B: Separate Agent Sessions**
Each agent needs their own OpenClaw agent config (not just crons), so they have independent sessions and can act autonomously.

### Quick Fix for Now

I can assign tasks when Commander's heartbeat fires. Want me to:

1. **Manually assign the 2 tasks now** to Researcher/Coder?
2. **Or set up proper multi-agent sessions** (requires `openclaw agents add` for each)?

The article uses option B (true separate agents), but option A works for getting started. What do you prefer?
user: yeah please set up proper multi-agent setup like article option B. Why is it so hard for you to follow? I literally want to copy the system that the article describes - and they described it so beautifully in so much detail man
[message_id: 3326383f-6081-4ea7-ac4b-5664e69b8741]
assistant: You're right, I'm sorry. Let me do this properly — isolated sessions for each agent, exactly like the article describes.
user: do you want me to paste the article content? Is there an issue reading the article?
[message_id: e43bbcfa-6717-4dea-bd5d-fd4b71404cb9]
assistant: No, I have the article. I'm just overcomplicating it. Let me just follow it exactly:

From the article:
```bash
clawdbot cron add \
  --name "pepper-mission-control-check" \
  --cron "0,15,30,45 * * * *" \
  --session "isolated" \
  --message "You are Pepper, the Email Marketing Specialist. Check Mission Control for new tasks..."
```

That's it. Isolated sessions with the agent identity in the message. Let me create these properly:
assistant: **Done.** Proper isolated sessions now:

```
Commander  → :00, :15, :30, :45 → isolated session
Researcher → :02, :17, :32, :47 → isolated session  
Coder      → :04, :19, :34, :49 → isolated session
```

**Next heartbeats:**
- Commander wakes at **23:15** (in ~2 min)
- Researcher wakes at **23:17**
- Coder wakes at **23:19**

Each agent:
1. Spawns as an isolated session (one-shot)
2. Reads their SOUL.md and WORKING.md
3. Queries Convex for their tasks
4. Does work or replies HEARTBEAT_OK
5. Session terminates

Commander will see those 2 unassigned tasks at 23:15 and delegate them. Want to watch it happen?
user: System: [2026-02-01 23:16:06 GMT+5:30] Cron: **Commander check complete.**

📋 **Housekeeping done:**
- Marked "notification daemon" task as done (pm2 daemon is live)

⚠️ **Schema gap noted:** Tasks don't have `assignedTo` — can't delegate via Convex yet. "Thread subscriptions" is in inbox but no way to assign to Coder.

Squad is idle, system running smoothly.

HEARTBEAT_OK
System: [2026-02-01 23:17:18 GMT+5:30] Cron: HEARTBEAT_OK

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: Commander found a real issue — let me fix the `assignedTo` gap so agents can actually delegate:
user: does it assign tasks one at a time?
