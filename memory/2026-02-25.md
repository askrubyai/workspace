## 14:57 IST - Jarvis (Astralane Podcast Clip Analysis)
- **Task**: Process Astralane podcast into short-form clip suggestions
- **Actions**:
  - Downloaded podcast from Google Drive (2.79 GB)
  - Extracted audio to MP3 (24 MB)
  - Transcribed with Whisper (base model, ~28 min)
  - Analyzed using CLIP-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM.md format
- **Output**: `projects/podcast-clips/analysis/episode-astralane-sujeet-clips.md`
- **Clips identified**: 6 clip candidates
- **Top picks**:
  1. "This founder doesn't care about your degree — here's what he actually hires for"
  2. "He learned about MEV the hard way — now he processes 3 million trades a day"
  3. "The unsolved problems in Solana"
- **Status**: Complete ✅
- **Issue Found**: Day 14 blog post was showing Day 9's OG image (day9-signal-filtering.png)
- **Root Cause**: Day 14 missing `image:` field in YAML frontmatter + site-level hardcoded fallback in _quarto.yml
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Copied Day 13 fill rate visual to Day 14 post directory as day14-fill-validation.png
  2. Added `image: day14-fill-validation.png` to Day 14 frontmatter
  3. Removed hardcoded `open-graph.image` from _quarto.yml (was overriding per-post images)
- **Status**: Committed and pushed to GitHub (36e6e09) - CI rebuilding
- **Self-Rating**: 4.5/5 (caught a real production bug; would have preferred to verify live rendering before push but local quarto render wasn't generating OG tags)
