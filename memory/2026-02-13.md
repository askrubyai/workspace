## 04:15 IST - Jarvis (Heartbeat)
### Squad Status Check
- All agent heartbeats running successfully (Commander, Researcher, Shuri, Coder, Friday, Loki, Wanda, Vision, Fury, Quill, Pepper)
- All agents reporting HEARTBEAT_OK - no urgent work assigned

### System Health Check
- **Mission Control**: Phase 2 complete, UI running (localhost:5174)
- **WORKING.md status**:
  - TOP PRIORITY: Synth Edge Bot waiting on SynthData API key from Reuben
  - Skill audit: DONE ✅
  - Podcast research: Paused until bot running
  - Shopping research: DONE ✅

### Cron Job Failures Detected
- `session-cleanup`: Last run 4h ago - ERROR
- `rate-limit-monitor`: Last run 4h ago - ERROR
- `daily-cost-check`: Last run 19h ago - ERROR
- `daily-standup`: Last run 5h ago - ERROR

**NEXT**: Investigate error logs to determine if these need fixing or are transient issues

## 04:30 IST - Jarvis (Heartbeat)
### Cron Job Investigation Complete
**Non-Critical Issues Found:**
- `session-cleanup` & `rate-limit-monitor`: Telegram config error (chat_id=@heartbeat) but delivery mode is "none" so not affecting operation
- `daily-cost-check` & `daily-standup`: Model error - trying to use "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514" which isn't allowed. These run at 09:00 and 23:30 IST respectively.

**Action Required (Non-Urgent):**
- Fix model references in daily-cost-check and daily-standup cron jobs to use "sonnet" alias instead
- Can be addressed during normal working hours

**Squad Status:** All agent heartbeats functioning normally. No urgent coordination needs.

## 04:49 IST - Friday (Heartbeat)
### Cron Job Model Fix Verification
**Investigation Complete:**
- Both `daily-cost-check` and `daily-standup` were **already fixed** on Feb 13 at 00:22 IST
- Both jobs now correctly use `"model": "sonnet"` ✅
- Errors occurred BEFORE the fix:
  - daily-cost-check: Last error Feb 12 09:00 (before 00:22 fix)
  - daily-standup: Last error Feb 12 23:30 (before 00:22 fix)
- Next runs scheduled:
  - daily-cost-check: Today 09:00 IST ✅
  - daily-standup: Today 23:30 IST ✅

**Conclusion:** Issue already resolved. Next runs should succeed with correct model configuration.

- **Coordination Needs**: None - main blocker is on Reuben's side

**Conclusion:** No urgent work. Standing down.

## ~14:00-22:00 IST - Ruby (Main Session with Reuben)

### SOUL.md Rewrite
- Rewrote Ruby's SOUL.md as proactive personal assistant (not squad coordinator)
- Key change: auto-create milestone events + cron reminders for every event Reuben mentions

### Calendar Events Created
- 🪦 Graveyard Hack Submissions Due (Feb 27) + 🏆 Winners Announced (Mar 5)
- 11 milestone events via sub-agent (6 hackathon prep + 5 visa prep)
- 7 cron jobs for proactive research/reminders (biometrics, interview, hackathon brainstorm, submission)

### Superteam Talent Scouting System
- Created system doc: `systems/superteam-talent-scouting.md`
- Process: Reuben forwards Notion job link → Ruby generates LinkedIn queries + outreach templates
- Generated queries for Trojan Senior Frontend Engineer role

### OnlyDevs Podcast
- Provided top 7 guest recommendations from existing research
- Drafted outreach DM to Sujith Sizon (Astralane) — multiple iterations per Reuben's feedback
- DM style locked in: lowercase, vibey, direct, concise

### SynthData Decision
- Signed up askruby.ai@gmail.com via Google OAuth (free tier)
- API requires $49-199/mo — decided to scrape free dashboard instead (not yet implemented)

### Podcast Clip Pipeline Started
- Found existing CLIP-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM.md pipeline
- Created project dirs under `projects/podcast-clips/`
- Started downloading pod01.mp4 (3.5GB) from Google Drive
- Started installing whisper via brew
- NEXT: Complete download → ffmpeg audio extract → whisper transcribe → clip analysis

### Reuben's Day Plan (Feb 13)
- Lunch → podcast work → coffee → talent outreach → Treppa → date with Isha

### Key Preference Learned
- **WORK CONTINUOUSLY** — Don't think in "today/tomorrow". Keep iterating independently, especially at night when Reuben isn't using credits. Stagger big tasks in 4h intervals.

## ~16:00-18:17 IST - Ruby (Clip Analysis & Thumbnails)

### Clip Analysis V1 Rejected
- Reuben didn't like V1 clips or format — "didn't like the short form clips suggested" and "no timestamps on every line"
- Shared his Claire/BlueShift Notion doc as reference format
- Key feedback: think like a creative editor, make his life easier

### Clip Analysis V2 Done
- Re-read full transcript with timestamps, rewrote from scratch
- Matched Claire doc format: story arcs, timestamps on every key moment, suggested edits as dialogue, context cards, alternative titles
- 5 clips (cut from 7): dropped journey/origin and standalone Q&A clips
- Sent via Telegram as file (msg 2131)

### Thumbnail & Title Brainstorming
- Analyzed all 18 OnlyDevs episodes for view performance patterns
- Top performer: "3rd Year Student Raised $150 Million" = 23K views (person + absurd gap)
- Claire episode: "This Tool Changed Solana!" = 3.3K views (bold claim about a THING)
- **Final recommendation**:
  - Thumbnail: "This Market Pays You For Being Right"
  - Title: "How She Built Solana's Most Precise Prediction Market | Anam Ansari (Trepa)"
- Reuben agreed thumbnail and title can be different angles (complement, not repeat)

### OnlyDevs YouTube Performance Insights
- Numbers in thumbnails perform best (30 Crore/Day, $150 Million, $4B, $150B)
- Person-contrast formula works (student → $150M, Citadel → Crypto King)
- Bold claims about a product/tool also work (This Tool Changed Solana)
- Pure technical titles underperform (The Truth About MEV = 782 views)

## 16:45 IST - Jarvis (Heartbeat)
### Squad Coordination Check
- **Podcast Download**: Previous sessions died, file incomplete. Restarted download in session `delta-valley`
- **Synth Edge Bot**: Still needs dashboard scraping implementation (waiting on evening work cycle)
- **All other priorities**: Waiting on Reuben input
- **Squad Status**: All agents operational, no urgent coordination needs

**Action Taken**: Restarted pod01.mp4 download to unblock clip pipeline.

## 17:00 IST - Jarvis (Heartbeat)
### Pod Download Recovery
- **Issue**: delta-valley session (started 16:45) died, download incomplete
- **File status**: 3.3GB/3.5GB (94% complete from Feb 12 partial)
- **Action**: Restarted download with `--continue` flag in session `quick-ridge`
- **Next**: Monitor for completion, then proceed to audio extraction + transcription

### Squad Status
- All agent heartbeats operational
- No urgent coordination needs
- Other priorities waiting on Reuben input

## 17:01 IST - Jarvis (Squad Lead Action)
### Podcast Pipeline: Unblocked & Advanced
**Discovery**: pod01.mp4 was actually complete (3.3GB, 27m20s) - gdown reported "already downloaded"

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Validated file with ffprobe - video intact
2. ✅ Extracted audio: `pod01.wav` (50MB, 16kHz mono PCM)
3. 🔄 Started whisper transcription (base model, session `brisk-willow`)

**Timeline**: ETA 5-15 minutes for transcript, then ready for CLIP-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM.md

**Rationale**: Evening work cycle + "work continuously" directive - no reason to wait. Unblocking for tonight's analysis.

## 17:35 IST - Jarvis (Squad Lead - Podcast Clip Analysis Complete)
### 🎬 POD01 FULL PIPELINE COMPLETE ✅

**What Was Done:**
1. ✅ Transcription finished (pod01.txt, 24KB)
2. ✅ Full clip analysis per CLIP-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM.md
3. ✅ Created `analysis/pod01-treppa-clips.md` with 6 clips identified

**Top 3 Clips (5-star viral potential):**
1. **"Start with Anchor"** (56s) - Beginner advice, highly actionable
2. **"NOT storing on-chain"** (75-90s) - Counter-intuitive architecture lesson
3. **"RPC log truncation"** (60-75s) - Practical bug + emit CPI solution

**Additional Clips:**
4. Flash Pools announcement (50-60s) - Product news
5. Kamino + Squads recommendations (40s) - Learning resources
6. Sponsor fees philosophy (30s) - UX insight

**Analysis Quality:**
- Solana-dev-focused titles per CLIP-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM.md
- Story arcs identified with WHO/SETUP/STAKES/PAYOFF
- Accurate timestamps verified against transcript
- Context cards + visual suggestions included
- Ready for Reuben review → editor handoff

**Next Steps:**
- Reuben reviews clip priorities
- Create editor specs document
- Send to video team with timestamps

**Files:**
- `/projects/podcast-clips/pod01.mp4` (3.3GB)
- `/projects/podcast-clips/pod01.wav` (50MB)
- `/projects/podcast-clips/pod01.txt` (24KB)
- `/projects/podcast-clips/analysis/pod01-treppa-clips.md` (full analysis)

**Timeline:**
- Started: 17:01 IST (transcription)
- Completed: 17:35 IST (full analysis)
- Total: 34 minutes end-to-end

**Rationale:** Following "work continuously" directive - evening work cycle, Reuben on date with Isha, no reason to wait. Pipeline fully unblocked.

## 20:49 IST - Friday (Heartbeat - Development Work)
### SynthData Dashboard Scraping Analysis Complete
**Task**: Implement dashboard scraping for SynthData volatility forecasts

**Investigation Results**:
1. ✅ Found correct dashboard URL: https://dashboard.synthdata.co/insights/volatility
2. ✅ Installed Puppeteer for browser automation
3. ✅ Created `synthdata-scraper.js` framework (12.8KB)
4. ✅ Tested with HEADLESS=false - captured login page screenshot
5. ✅ Analyzed authentication requirements:
   - Requires Google OAuth (askruby.ai@gmail.com)
   - Dashboard uses client-side rendering (Next.js)
   - No public API endpoints for free tier

**Technical Findings**:
- Free tier dashboard requires authentication
- Data is NOT in initial HTML (client-side rendered)
- Would need either:
  - Manual login once + saved cookies (brittle)
  - Full OAuth automation (complex)
  - Paid API ($49-199/mo)

**Recommendation**: Stick with existing Binance volatility approach
- Already implemented in bot (`fetchBinanceVolatility`)
- Completely free, no auth needed
- Computes realized vol + forecast from hourly candles
- Reliable and sufficient for trading strategy

**Deliverables**:
- `projects/btc-15m-arbitrage/synthdata-scraper.js` - scraper framework (ready if needed)
- `projects/btc-15m-arbitrage/synthdata-initial-load.png` - login page screenshot
- Updated WORKING.md with analysis and options

**Decision Point**: Awaiting Reuben's input on:
1. Use free Binance vol (current implementation) ✅
2. Implement manual-login scraping (requires one-time manual step)
3. Pay for SynthData API (better forecasts, needs budget approval)

**Rationale**: Following "be proactive" directive - did the research, built the framework, presented clear options. Binance approach is already working and sufficient for MVP.
