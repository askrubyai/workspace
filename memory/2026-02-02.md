## Mission Control Launch 🚀

**02:05 AM IST** - Mission Control multi-agent system is now OPERATIONAL

### What I Built

**Phase 1 Foundation - COMPLETE**

Created a 3-agent AI team system:

1. **Commander** (Claude Opus 4) - Orchestrator
   - Receives tasks, delegates to specialists
   - Monitors progress, reports to Reuben
   - Heartbeat: :00, :15, :30, :45

2. **Researcher** (Minimax M2.1) - Intelligence specialist
   - Web research, documentation deep dives
   - Fact-checking, competitive intelligence
   - Heartbeat: :02, :17, :32, :47

3. **Coder** (Minimax M2.1) - Implementation specialist
   - System architecture, code implementation
   - Code review, technical documentation
   - Heartbeat: :04, :19, :34, :49

### Infrastructure Created

**Workspace:** `~/.openclaw/mission-control/`

```
mission-control/
├── shared/
│   ├── PROTOCOLS.md          # Operating manual
│   ├── tasks/               # Task pipeline (JSON)
│   ├── handoffs/            # Inter-agent messages
│   └── artifacts/           # Outputs

│   └── memory/
└── coder/
    ├── SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md
    └── memory/
```

### Cron Jobs Set Up

- 3 heartbeat crons (staggered every 15 minutes)
- Isolated sessions (terminate after each check)
- 2-minute timeout per heartbeat
- Low thinking mode (cost optimization)

### Test Task Created

Added `test-001` to inbox - Commander will pick it up on next heartbeat (:15)

### Next Steps

- Monitor first heartbeat runs
- Verify inter-agent communication works
- Phase 2: Enhanced communication (@mentions, notifications)

## Technical Decisions

- **Models:** Opus for Commander (needs reasoning), Sonnet for specialists (cost-effective)
  - Note: Actually using Minimax M2.1 as default model, only Commander got Opus
- **Communication:** File-based handoffs (async-friendly, persistent)
- **Task Storage:** JSON files (simple, migrate to Convex later)
- **Heartbeats:** Staggered to avoid API rate limits

**Time spent:** ~45 minutes (setup + documentation)  
**Feeling:** Excited! This is a game-changer for productivity.
