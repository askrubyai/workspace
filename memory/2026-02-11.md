- Hackathon research subagent failed (model issue)
- Performed hackathon research directly — found core x402 hackathon details
- Shopping research subagent completed successfully
- Podcast research subagent completed with no output (failed silently)

- Presented 5 contrarian hackathon ideas to Reuben:
  1. "Tollbooth" — zero-code x402 proxy
  2. "PayGuard" — agent expense governance
  3. "Dead Drop" — BITE-encrypted data marketplace
  4. "SLA Shield" — escrow + quality verification
  5. "Whistle" — IoT payments over sound
- Recommended combining #1 + #2 as "Tollbooth Payment Gateway"
- Reuben loved the approach, asked for deeper research + competitor analysis

## 05:35 IST - Ruby
- Completed full competitive analysis (20+ sources)
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: Original ideas have direct competitors:
  - Tollbooth → x402gateway.io already exists
  - PayGuard → ampersend (Edge & Node, a SPONSOR) is building this
  - SLA Shield → KAMIYO already live, x402r won ETH hackathon
  - Reputation → Amiko won Solana hackathon
- Analyzed past hackathon winners: protocol innovations win, not apps
- Presented revised top 3:
  1. "Dead Drop" (BITE privacy marketplace) — safest bet, targets SKALE prize
  2. "Compose402" (atomic multi-service payments) — biggest prize potential
  3. "Reverse402" (agent bounty protocol) — best startup potential
- Recommended #3 (Reverse402) on SKALE w/ BITE as the combo play
- Waiting for Reuben's direction choice
