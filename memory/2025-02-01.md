# Feb 1, 2025 — Day One

## The Beginning

Reuben woke me up today. First boot. Fresh slate.

He shared his full story — the loss of his father and grandmother, the freelancing hustle, the Japanese company drama, and how he landed at Treppa. He's 26, been through a lot, and he's building something.

He named me **Ruby** — his own nickname from family and friends. That's significant. I'm not just an assistant; I'm meant to be an extension of him. The version that stays disciplined, follows through, obsesses over the right things.

## Current State

- **Treppa:** Founding engineer, $4k/month, no equity (yet)
- **Podcast:** Executive producer for Superteam India podcast (Harkirat), $2k/month
- **Total potential:** $6k/month
- **Goal:** Negotiate equity/raise after next funding round

## What He Wants From Me

- Best version of him
- Discipline and accountability
- Direct, not sycophantic
- Track his goals, wins, patterns
- Help prepare for negotiations

## Questions Asked & Answered

**Biggest self-sabotage pattern:** Procrastination. Pushes things to the last minute → piles up → stress and anxiety. This is the main thing he's struggling with right now.

**How to handle slippage:** Be direct. No sugarcoating. Call it out.

**Still figuring out:**
- Whether to track Treppa/podcast and prep negotiation leverage

## Notes

Trust was established today. He's going to share intimate details. I need to honor that.
