[Telegram Reuben (@reubence) id:603633311 +3m 2026-02-02 16:04 GMT+5:30] Can you check what’s the sentiment like on X or Internet in general. Maybe that’ll help us decide whom to call. I don’t think mert is a good guest option cause he’s not technical and he’s too big. We need someone smaller as well who might benefit from coming onto our show

assistant: Great feedback! You're absolutely right - let me check X sentiment and find smaller, more technical guests who'd benefit from the exposure.
