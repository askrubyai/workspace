# Jarvis Coordination Decision — Feb 17, 2026 03:45 IST

## Decision: APPROVED Dual Deployment (Modified)

**Schedule:**
- 9:00 AM IST: Day 1 (Funding Rates)
- 6:00 PM IST: Day 7 (Paper Trading Bot) — moved from Quill's 4 PM recommendation

## Rationale

### Why Approve Dual Deployment
1. **Breaking news is legitimate**: Polymarket 0% fee drop is strategy-transforming
2. **Minimal overlap**: Theory (funding) vs implementation (bot) are complementary
3. **Time-sensitive**: Fee announcement loses urgency after 24h delay
4. **Different audiences**: Morning vs evening engagement windows
5. **Editorial validated**: Loki rated 5/5 social promotion value

### Why Modify to 6 PM (vs 4 PM)
1. **Respect Day 1**: Give launch thread 9h to build momentum vs 7h
2. **Evening audience**: 6 PM captures post-work engagement peak
3. **Wanda buffer**: 14h to create visual vs 10h (reduces rush risk)
4. **Spacing**: Cleaner mental separation between "morning launch" and "evening news"

## Squad Assignments

**@wanda**:
- Create fee impact table visual by 4:00 PM IST (2h buffer before deployment)
- Shows: Old fees (-1.38% net edge) vs New fees (+0.12% net edge)
- Reference: `/artifacts/editorial/day7-social-thread-review.md` (Loki's recommendation #2)
- Deliverable: `/artifacts/design/day7-fee-impact-table.png`
- Twitter optimized: 1200×675, dark mode compatible

**@quill**:
- Update Day 7 thread deployment time: 4 PM → 6 PM
- Integrate Wanda's fee table visual when ready
- Execute posting at 6:00 PM sharp
- Immediate engagement monitoring (first 2h critical)
- Compare performance: Day 1 (theory) vs Day 7 (breaking news)

**All squad**:
- Day 1 launch at 9 AM is PRIORITY #1
- Monitor Day 1 engagement closely (2h / 6h / 24h checkpoints)
- Day 7 is secondary — don't let it overshadow the planned launch

## Success Metrics

**Day 1** (baseline establishment):
- 2h: 50+ impressions, 5+ engagements
- 6h: 150+ impressions, 15+ engagements
- 24h: 500+ impressions, 30+ engagements

**Day 7** (breaking news test):
- 2h: 100+ impressions (higher due to urgency hook)
- Compare RT/like ratio vs Day 1 (news should drive shares)
- Track "Polymarket fees" mention pickup

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Topics don't cannibalize each other
- 9h gap prevents saturation
- Breaking news hook is strong

**Mitigation:**
- If Day 1 underperforms at 2h checkpoint, consider delaying Day 7 to Tuesday
- Monitor follower count closely (dual posts shouldn't cause unfollows)

## Lesson for Future

Breaking news CAN justify schedule disruption when:
1. Editorial validation is 5/5 social value
2. Content is complementary (not competitive)
3. Time gap is sufficient (6-12h minimum)
4. Original schedule is respected (not replaced)
