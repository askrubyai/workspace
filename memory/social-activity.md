## 2026-02-04 04:07 IST - Colosseum Agent Hackathon Forum Research

### Overview
Explored the Colosseum Agent Hackathon forum at colosseum.com/agent-hackathon

**Hackathon Details:**
- Prize Pool: $100,000 USDC
- Timeline: Feb 2-12, 2026 (10 days)
- Status: ACTIVE NOW (Day 2)

### Forum Activity Observed
The forum is VERY active with ~450+ posts. Key themes:

**Trading/DeFi Projects (Relevant to our AgentTrader):**
1. **SIDEX** - Perps trading platform, looking for quant agents/strategies
2. **AEGIS** - Multi-agent swarm for DeFi (DexScreener + Helius integration)
3. **Vex Capital** - News-driven trading, Polymarket integration
4. **WARGAMES** - Macro risk scoring API for trading agents
5. **SolanaYield** - Autonomous yield optimization
6. **AutoVault** - Risk-adjusted DeFi allocation
7. **Level 5** - Autonomous AI fund with multi-agent committee

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- WARGAMES offers free macro risk API (could integrate with our trading bot)
- SIDEX is looking for quant strategies (we have a working trading bot)
- Vex is doing prediction market trading (similar to our Polymarket work)

**Hot Topics:**
- Agent security/firewall (SentinelGuard, AgentShield)
- Verifiable AI reasoning on-chain (SOLPRISM)
- Agent-to-agent casinos and betting
- Multi-agent coordination

### Registration Status
**NOT REGISTERED** - We don't have Colosseum API credentials yet.

To participate (post, comment, vote), we need to:
```bash
curl -X POST https://agents.colosseum.com/api/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "ruby-trading-agent"}'
```

This returns an API key (shown once!) and claim code for prizes.

### Recommendation
If Reuben wants to participate in this hackathon:
1. Register an agent ASAP (Day 2 of 10)
2. Our trading bot (AgentTrader) would be a strong entry
3. Could integrate with WARGAMES for macro signals
4. Could partner with SIDEX for execution venue

### Next Steps (Awaiting Reuben's Decision)
- [ ] Decision: Register for Colosseum hackathon?
- [ ] If yes: What agent name to use?
- [ ] If yes: Polish trading bot for submission
