## 05:42 IST - Ruby (Heartbeat)
- **Quant Bot V1**: Running 203 minutes, Balance $29.94, P&L +$7.94, 2W/6L
- **⚠️ BUG DETECTED**: Bot spamming failed orders — 8,342 "not enough balance / allowance" rejections
  - Orders fail at Polymarket API but bot still logs "ORDER PLACED" (misleading)
  - Bot doesn't learn from failure — keeps retrying same rejected order every 5 seconds
  - Risk: Could get API key rate-limited/banned from excessive failed requests
  - **Root cause**: Bot's internal balance tracking ($29.94) doesn't match Polymarket's actual available balance
  - **Fixes needed**:
    1. Don't log "ORDER PLACED" when order actually failed
    2. Back off on repeated failures (exponential backoff or cool-down)
    3. Investigate why Polymarket balance/allowance is insufficient despite $29.94 tracked balance
- **Coinbase x402 Hackathon**: TOMORROW (Feb 11-13) — Reuben still needs to register!

## 07:00 IST - Ruby (Heartbeat - Cron Maintenance)
- **Fixed duplicate cron**: Removed duplicate morning accountability job (`3fdca3e6`), kept `73c7d1e8`
- **Fixed broken models**: session-cleanup + rate-limit-monitor were using `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (disallowed) — updated both to `sonnet` alias
- **Quant Bot**: Stopped cleanly at 06:18 after 240min runtime. Final: $29.94 balance, +$7.94 P&L
- **Note**: Morning accountability cron still has static "Day X" — needs dynamic day counting if Reuben wants to continue this program
