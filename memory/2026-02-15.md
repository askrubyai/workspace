## Oroboros Pitch — Full Day Evolution

### Direction Changes (4 pivots in one day)
1. **4:00 AM** — Reuben asked to simplify from 15-slide prediction market pitch to ~2min read
2. **4:10 AM** — "Why can't I build on existing prediction market APIs?" → routing layer idea
3. **4:11 AM** — "Does it make sense to hedge against gold?" → Ruby pushed back honestly: retail gold holders wouldn't hedge, but gold CAN hedge everything else
4. **4:13 AM** — Reuben confirmed: build on existing prediction market APIs, gold-in/gold-out
5. **1:40 PM** — Reuben shared tramplin.io (premium staking/lottery on Solana) for inspiration
6. **1:42 PM** — Confirmed direction: existing prediction market APIs
7. **2:08 PM** — MAJOR PIVOT: "Users shouldn't take positions — we should do it for them. Slider showing cost to hedge. Like insurance." Also wants better names (unserious, like soanpari)
8. **2:16 PM** — "Study the math. Treat this as your own baby. Be more proactive. Update SOUL.md."
9. **5:15 PM** — "Redo Notion — shorter, more actionable, add names section at end"

### Final Product Concept
- **Gold protection protocol** with slider UX
- User picks % of $GOLD to protect → we handle everything
- Tiered: Free (>20% crash, yield-funded) → Secure (>15%) → Fortress (>10%)
- Backend: Peer-to-pool vault (Ribbon model), Pyth oracle
- **Killer feature:** Free catastrophe insurance funded by Oro staking yield (0.17%/mo cost < 0.29%/mo yield)

### Math Summary
- Gold GVZ = ~33% implied vol
- ATM 30-day put ≈ 3.78%/month (too expensive)
- >20% OTM put ≈ 0.17%/month (cheaper than Oro yield = FREE)
- >15% = 0.45%/mo, >10% = 1.05%/mo, >5% = 2.1%/mo
- Business viable at $10M+ Oro TVL, not at current $450K
- Revenue: 0.25% spread on protected value

### Key Findings
- **Drift has NO gold perps** — can't use perps for hedging
- **Polymarket gold-specific markets are rare** — prediction market routing unreliable
- **Peer-to-pool vault is the only viable on-chain backend**
- Oro GRAIL grant program has NO public docs/application process — need to contact directly

## SOUL.md Updates (Feb 15)
Added 5 new operating rules learned from Reuben:
- TREAT HIS PROJECTS AS MY OWN
- ITERATE THROUGH DIRECTIONS FAST (ideas evolve rapidly)
- BE HONEST ABOUT VIABILITY (pushback with math)
- NAMES/BRANDING MATTER (unserious, multilingual, story-telling)
- SIMPLIFY RELENTLESSLY (slider > market cards > order book)

## Podcast Coordination
- Reuben created group with Sujith, Kirat, and @paarug for next OnlyDevs episode
- Topic: Deep dive into what they're building at Astralane
- Looking for slot first half of next week
- Style note: Reuben's messages are direct, tag people, suggest timeframe upfront

## Quant Blog
- Day 4 published: "Extracting Implied Volatility from Binary Options (And Trading the Gap)"
- Key finding: VRP per-trade (0.037%) is 80× smaller than Polymarket's 3% taker fee
- Tomorrow: regime detector for post-spike windows

## Morning Routine
- Sent 8:30 AM briefing with schedule, workout (Week 1 Day 2), priorities
- Lunch in Pavai ~12:30 PM confirmed
