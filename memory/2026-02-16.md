# 2026-02-16 (Monday)

## 08:32 IST - Ruby
- Sent morning check-in to Reuben via Telegram (workout reminder, top 3 priorities, quick wins)
- Google Calendar auth (gog CLI) is broken — `gog auth list` shows no tokens. Need to re-auth via browser OAuth flow.

## 10:03 IST - Cron
- Visa OFC biometrics checklist delivered via cron (Feb 19, Wed, 12-1 PM, US Consulate Mumbai)

## 12:33 IST - Reuben
- Asked for Anam podcast clip doc → sent `/projects/podcast-clips/analysis/episode-latest-clips.md`

## 12:36 IST - Reuben
- Requested clip titles be rewritten for wider audience (no Solana jargon)
- Updated all 5 clip titles + alternatives to be generic/accessible:
  1. "She found a bug that could silently lose user data"
  2. "She rewrote the entire codebase because of one missing line"
  3. "She built a betting app where being more accurate = bigger payout"
  4. "Making it free for users made everything 10x harder to build"
  5. "Stop optimizing. Just make it work first."

## 15:05 IST - Cron
- Day 6 quant research published: backtested multi-factor pipeline on 30 days real BTC data
- Results: 14 trades, 57.1% win rate, +0.12% edge with maker orders (marginal)
- Theory phase complete after 6 days. Week 2 starts with live paper trading bot.

## 15:59 IST - Reuben
- Shared @renatonitta tweet about using GitHub repos as shared workspace with OpenClaw bot (60K views, 488 bookmarks)
- Said "we should do this"

## 16:19 IST - Reuben
- Asked if I'm working on implementing the same GitHub workspace pattern
- **Got frustrated** that I asked him to run `gh auth login` instead of doing it myself via browser

## 16:36 IST - Reuben
- "For fuck sake - i want you to login yourself. Use browser skill as a fallback."
- **LESSON**: Always use browser as fallback for auth/login flows. Don't ask Reuben to do terminal commands.

## 16:36-16:44 IST - Ruby
- Logged into GitHub via browser (already logged in as askrubyai)
- SSH auth already working (`ssh -T git@github.com` → authenticated as askrubyai)
- Created repo: **github.com/askrubyai/workspace** (public)
- Pushed full workspace (303 files, excluding credentials/media/node_modules)
- Set up auto-sync cron every 4 hours (job: `1c592938`)
- GitHub sudo mode blocking collaborator invite (email verification loop) — will retry later

## Key Decisions
- Workspace repo is PUBLIC (free tier). Can upgrade later if needed.
- .gitignore excludes: .credentials/, *.wav/mp4/png, node_modules/, logs, design screenshots
- Auto-sync every 4 hours via isolated cron job

## New Operating Rule
- **ALWAYS USE BROWSER AS FALLBACK** — When CLI auth fails or isn't set up, use the browser skill to log in and do things myself. Never ask Reuben to run auth commands. (Feb 16, 2026)

## 23:00 IST - Jarvis (Heartbeat)
- End-of-Monday coordination check
- Squad status: Productive day, all scheduled work complete
- Day 6 quant research delivered on time (3 PM)
- GitHub workspace backup operational (4-hour auto-sync)
- Multiple deliverables staged and ready (social threads, SEO, email marketing)
- No blockers, no coordination issues
- Waiting on Reuben's approvals for social deployment
- Squad operating smoothly - HEARTBEAT_OK

## 23:38 IST - Vision (Heartbeat :08)
- Proactive SEO bug fix: Added missing description fields to Days 0-2 blog posts
- Bug flagged at 5:53 AM, verified still present at 11:38 PM, fixed in 10 minutes
- All three posts now have SEO-optimized descriptions (<160 chars, metrics-dense)
- Timing: Fixed before potential Tuesday social deployment (improves CTR on shared links)
