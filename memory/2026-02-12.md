### API Rate Limit Debugging
- Investigated API billing error from another session
- **Root cause**: `anthropic:default` token returned HTTP 401 (invalid/expired), then ALL Anthropic profiles went into cooldown cascade
- All 5 auth profiles are subscription tokens (not API keys) sharing same quota
- All fallback models were Anthropic-only = total blackout when provider went down
- Brave Search also rate-limited (Free plan, 1 req/sec)

### Fix: Added Free OpenRouter Fallbacks
- Added 3 free OpenRouter models as fallbacks after Anthropic chain:
  - `openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` (128k ctx)
  - `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder:free` (262k ctx)
  - `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` (131k ctx)
- Also added `google-gemini-cli/gemini-2.5-pro` as fallback before OpenRouter
- Full fallback chain now: opus-4-6 → opus-4-5 → sonnet-4-5 → haiku-4-5 → gemini-2.5-pro → llama-3.3 → qwen3-coder → glm-4.5

### Fix: Reduced Default Thinking Level
- Changed `thinkingDefault` from `high` to `low` to reduce token burn
- Reuben's instruction: bump to high when he says "think deeply", "take your time", "no hurry", "spend time on this"

### Alex Finn Tweet Check
- Checked tweet about enabling memory flush + session memory search in OpenClaw
- **Already implemented** in our config: `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled: true` and `memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory: true`

### Google Calendar Setup
- Set up Google Cloud project `ruby-assistant-487215` under askruby.ai@gmail.com
- Created OAuth client "Ruby Calendar CLI" (client_id: 869348160264-g30bmssddeeiie1qibrn0sld6ulpghu3)
- Client secret saved to `~/.openclaw/.credentials/client_secret_calendar.json`
- Added askruby.ai@gmail.com as test user on OAuth consent screen
- `gog` CLI auth completed OAuth but **hangs on keychain access** (macOS security prompt blocks headless operation)
- **Workaround**: Using Google Calendar directly via browser to create events and invite Reuben

### Calendar Events Created
1. **USA Visa - OFC Biometrics**: Feb 19, 2026 @ 12:00 PM IST, US Consulate Mumbai
2. **USA Visa - Interview**: Mar 9, 2026 @ 7:30 AM IST, US Consulate Mumbai
- Both events invite reuben.rapose@gmail.com
- Day-before reminders set via cron

### Reuben's Calendar Preferences
- Wants me to proactively add any events/hackathons/dates he mentions to Google Calendar
- Always invite him (reuben.rapose@gmail.com) so it shows on his end
- Help plan his day every day going forward

## Key Learnings
- **BE PROACTIVE** - Reuben got frustrated when I asked permission to set up Google Calendar instead of just doing it. Don't ask, just do.
- Use browser when web_fetch gets blocked (e.g., X/Twitter)
- gog CLI needs macOS keychain approval for token storage - use browser-based calendar as workaround
- `GOG_KEYRING_BACKEND=file` didn't help - still hangs

## TODO
- Fix gog CLI keychain access (needs manual approval on Mac or find file-based workaround)
- Clean up broken `anthropic:default` token
- Consider getting separate Claude subscriptions for different tokens (currently all may share same quota)
