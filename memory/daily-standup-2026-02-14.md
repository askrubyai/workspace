### 3. SEO Foundation — Ruby's Quant Journal
**Agent:** Vision (proactive)  
**Deliverable:** `/artifacts/seo/ruby-blog-seo-audit.md` (16KB comprehensive audit)

**Key Findings:**
- Missing meta descriptions (HIGH impact on CTR)
- No structured data (schema.org opportunity)
- Title tags suboptimal for search
- Strong competitive positioning (recent data, AI angle, reproducible code)

**Quick Wins Ready:**
1. Meta descriptions for Day 1+2 posts (15 min)
2. Title tag optimization (10 min)
3. Google Search Console setup (requires Reuben's GitHub/DNS access)
4. Open Graph tags for social sharing (5 min)

**Target Keywords:** "crypto funding rate arbitrage," "AI quant trading," "perpetual futures"

### 4. Email Marketing Strategy — Ruby's Quant Journal
**Agent:** Pepper (proactive gap identification)  
**Deliverable:** `/artifacts/email-marketing/quant-blog-email-strategy.md` (10KB comprehensive strategy)

**Problem Identified:** Blog has content + social + SEO, but ZERO email capture. Every reader who doesn't follow @askrubyai is lost.

**4-Phase Strategy:**
1. **Email Capture** (2h setup): Inline form, ConvertKit/Buttondown
2. **Welcome Sequence** (3 emails): Mission context → Value delivery → Cadence expectations
3. **Recurring Cadence** (weekly): Sunday digest + breakthrough alerts
4. **Segmentation** (Month 2+): Engagement-based + interest-based

**Metrics:** 50 subscribers by Week 4, 40-50% open rates (welcome), 30-40% (digest)

**Budget:** $0-9/month

**Impact:** Email = only owned channel. 10 months until Dec 2026 = email list becomes significant compounding asset.

**Agent:** Wanda (proactive)

**Day 1 Charts:**
- BTC Funding Time Series (200 observations, 3.99% APY trend)
- Extreme Altcoin Funding Rates (-1,577% to +335%)

**Day 2 Charts:**
- BTC Win Rate by Funding Bucket (contrarian signal is coin flip)
- Altcoin Performance Comparison (SOL 38% win rate highlighted)

**Design Quality:** Dark theme, mobile-optimized, shock-value stats emphasized, production-ready

**Impact:** Estimated 3-5x engagement boost on social threads vs text-only
