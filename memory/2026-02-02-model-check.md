assistant: Hey Reuben! 💎 Fresh session, fresh possibilities. 

What would you like to tackle today?
user: which model are you using sir?
[message_id: 52118201-bb48-4091-b6eb-77168dce025a]
assistant: I'm running on **Claude Sonnet 4** (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514) — both as current and default model.

Need me to switch to a different model for something specific?
user: now which?
[message_id: 7e45ed0c-44a8-4eb8-a4d4-ed4db6c02159]
assistant: Still **Claude Sonnet 4** (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514). 

Same model as when we started this session - nothing's changed. Want me to switch to something else?
