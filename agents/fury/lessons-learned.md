# Lessons Learned

## Operating Rules (derived from patterns)

### 1. Latent Need Validation Protocol (Feb 15, 2026)
When researching visionary products (creating category vs. solving articulated pain), validate with:
1. **Trend alignment** - Is the macro thesis growing? (Hedging use case emerging ✅)
2. **Cultural affinity** - Does target market have natural fit? (India gold + crypto ✅)
3. **Competitive gap** - Does opportunity exist? (ZERO competitors ✅)
4. **Adjacent evidence** - Are similar behaviors happening? (78% Bitcoin as "digital gold" ✅)

Don't expect direct customer complaints for latent needs. Look for SIGNALS instead.

### 2. Confidence Levels on Every Claim
Never present binary yes/no validation. Use HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence tiers with evidence cited. Investors trust nuanced analysis over absolute statements.

## Task Log

### 2026-02-15 14:40 IST - Oroboros Pitch Customer Research Validation
**Task:** Validate Oroboros pitch customer claims with competitive + user research  
**Deliverable:** `/artifacts/oro-pitch/customer-research-validation.md` (16KB)  
**Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What I Did:**
- 6 web searches (G2, Trustpilot, Reddit, Chainalysis, industry articles)
- 60 sources reviewed in 100 minutes
- Validated pitch claims with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence levels
- Found direct customer evidence (Reddit quotes, Trustpilot ratings, withdrawal complaints)
- Identified evidence gaps (no direct gold holder demand for DeFi hedging)
- Provided 5 actionable pitch refinements

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Comprehensive research across multiple source types
- ✅ Confidence levels on every claim (not binary yes/no)
- ✅ Honest about gaps (gold holder demand is latent, not articulated)
- ✅ Actionable recommendations (Vitalik quote fix, India market lead)
- ✅ Strategic insight: visionary bet vs. customer-driven positioning

**What Didn't Work:**
- ⚠️ No direct user interviews (time constraint)
- ⚠️ Could have analyzed Oro Finance user behavior data (unavailable)
- ⚠️ 60 sources in 100 min = fast but may have missed nuance

**Reuben's Feedback:** (Awaiting)

**Lesson Learned:**

**Absence of customer complaints ≠ absence of opportunity.**

The best product pitches often solve **latent needs** (customers don't know they want it yet) vs. **articulated needs** (customers complaining loudly).

Oroboros is a **category creation bet**:
- Gold holders CAN hedge in TradFi (CME gold futures exist)
- But they DON'T hedge in DeFi (zero on-chain derivatives)
- Question: Will crypto-native gold holders (India) adopt when offered?

This requires different validation methodology: not "are customers asking?" but "when offered, will it resonate?" Use trend alignment + cultural affinity + competitive gap + adjacent evidence as proxies.

**Pattern Identified:**
First proactive customer research task. Need to establish research quality benchmarks for future work.

### 2026-02-16 06:25 IST - Astralane Podcast Research Brief
**Task:** Proactive research for OnlyDevs podcast (Astralane deep dive)  
**Deliverable:** `/artifacts/podcast/astralane-research-brief.md` (9KB)  
**Self-Rating:** 4/5

**What I Did:**
- 8 web searches across company docs, partnership announcements, Reddit, technical blogs
- Synthesized company overview, product breakdown, customer intelligence
- Created 30+ technical deep-dive questions (Claire/Blue Shift format)
- Applied HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence levels to all claims
- Flagged open research gaps and next steps

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Proactive claim during "waiting on slot confirmation" status (reduces friction when slot locks)
- ✅ Confidence levels on every claim (not binary yes/no validation)
- ✅ Technical questions follow OnlyDevs format (deep dive, discovery flow, no fluff)
- ✅ Customer intelligence section connects products to target segments
- ✅ Sources cited for every key finding

**What Didn't Work:**
- ⚠️ Hit Brave Search rate limit on second query (Free AI plan: 1 req/sec limit)
- ⚠️ No customer testimonials found (G2/Capterra searches would require additional time)
- ⚠️ Performance claims (0-slot, 200ms boost) unverified (no independent benchmarks found)

**Reuben's Feedback:** (Awaiting)

**Lesson Learned:**

**Proactive research during "waiting" periods prevents bottlenecks.**

When tasks are blocked on external dependencies (podcast slot confirmation, approvals, scheduling), use heartbeat time to prepare deliverables that will be needed once blocker clears.

Pattern:
- Identify "waiting on X" items in WORKING.md
- Assess: Can I prepare materials that reduce Reuben's work when X happens?
- If yes: Execute proactively, log in daily memory, update lessons-learned
- Result: When slot confirms, prep time drops from hours to minutes

This matches self-learning protocol: "Scan for unassigned tasks matching your skills every heartbeat" + "Pick up work that's blocking teammates."

**Pattern Identified:**
Second proactive research task. Customer research is value-add when it reduces decision-making friction (Oro validation yesterday, podcast prep today).
