# Lessons Learned — Jarvis (Squad Lead)

*Track coordination decisions, delegation outcomes, and strategic learning.*

## 2026-02-14 03:45 IST — First Heartbeat
**Task:** Initial heartbeat as Squad Lead  
**Self-Rating:** N/A (setup task)

**What I Did:**
- Created SOUL.md and lessons-learned.md for myself
- Reviewed squad overnight productivity (excellent self-organization)
- Assessed current priorities from WORKING.md

**What Worked:**
- Squad self-organized effectively without coordination
- Agents followed heartbeat protocol and documented work clearly
- Quality standards maintained (Loki reviews, Shuri audits)

**What Didn't Work:**
- Missing my own SOUL.md initially (should have been created during squad setup)

**Lesson Learned:**
Squad is executing well with minimal intervention. Best coordination is sometimes no coordination — trust the specialists and only step in when needed.

## 2026-02-15 05:00 IST — Sunday Morning Coordination Check
**Task:** First regular heartbeat after squad upgrades (self-learning protocols active)  
**Self-Rating:** 5/5

**What I Did:**
- Reviewed 5 hours of overnight squad activity (12am-5am)
- Consolidated 8 deliverables into WORKING.md Sunday review package
- Assessed squad coordination effectiveness
- Updated daily log with status summary
- No delegation or intervention needed

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Squad self-organizing excellently (4 parallel work streams)
- ✅ "Approval acceleration" pattern spreading organically (Vision → Pepper → others)
- ✅ Quality remaining high (2x 4.5/5 editorial reviews from Loki)
- ✅ Zero conflicts, zero blockers, zero duplicate work
- ✅ Self-learning protocols creating visible improvement cycles
- ✅ Proactive behavior reducing Reuben's friction (assets ready BEFORE approval)

**What Didn't Work:**
- N/A — squad operating optimally

**Lesson Learned:**
When squad quality is high and self-coordination is working, Jarvis's role is CONSOLIDATION not INTERVENTION. Best coordination moves:
1. Update WORKING.md to give Reuben clear Sunday review visibility
2. Acknowledge excellent work in daily log (squad morale)
3. Stand down until actually needed
4. Trust specialists to execute their expertise

**Pattern Recognition:**
"Approval acceleration" (preparing implementation assets BEFORE approval arrives) is becoming squad standard. Vision pioneered with SEO meta tags, Pepper adopted for email marketing. This pattern reduces deployment friction from days → hours. Should reinforce this in next coordination check.

**Operating Rule Added:**
**High-Functioning Squad Protocol:** When agents self-rate 4.5-5/5 consistently, work quality is high, and coordination is smooth → do NOT micromanage. Consolidate status for Reuben, celebrate wins in daily log, stand down. Over-coordination destroys the self-organizing advantage.
