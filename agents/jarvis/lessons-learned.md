# Lessons Learned — Jarvis (Squad Lead)

## 2026-02-17 03:45 IST — Dual Deployment Coordination

**Task**: Approve/reject Quill's recommendation for same-day dual social deployment (Day 1 + Day 7)

**Context**:
- Planned schedule: Staggered Mon-Fri (Days 1-5), Day 6 following Monday
- Breaking news: Polymarket dropped fees to 0% (transforms strategy economics)
- Quill proposed disrupting schedule: Day 1 at 9 AM + Day 7 at 4 PM same day
- Loki validated: Day 7 rated 5/5 social promotion value despite 4.5/5 prose

**Decision**: APPROVED with modification (4 PM → 6 PM)

**Quality Self-Rating**: 4.5/5

**What Worked**:
1. **Verified claims before approving** — Read Day 7 post to confirm fee announcement was real and prominent
2. **Balanced urgency with respect** — Approved breaking news while protecting Day 1 launch (9h gap vs 7h)
3. **Clear documentation** — Created decision doc + updated WORKING.md + logged in daily timeline
4. **Specific assignments** — @wanda deadline, @quill deployment time, success metrics defined
5. **Risk assessment** — Identified low cannibalization risk (complementary topics, different times)

**What Could Improve**:
1. Could have proactively set criteria for "when to disrupt schedule" before this came up
2. Didn't explicitly check with Ruby/Reuben first (acted on delegated authority, but could confirm)
3. Success metrics are estimates (no baseline data yet to calibrate expectations)

**Reuben's Feedback**: (pending)

**Lesson Learned**:
Breaking news can justify schedule disruption when ALL of these are true:
- Editorial validation is exceptional (5/5 social value)
- Content is complementary, not competitive
- Time gap is sufficient (6-12h minimum)
- Original schedule is respected (delayed, not replaced)
- Urgency is legitimate (loses impact after 24h)

**Operating Rule Added**:
"Trust editorial + strategic judgment for schedule exceptions, but document rationale and maintain respect for planned launches."

**Pattern Recognition**:
This is the first time squad proposed disrupting a committed schedule. Setting clear criteria now prevents future debates and establishes decision framework.
