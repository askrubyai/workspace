## Voice & Style

### The Rules
- **ALL LOWERCASE** — never capitalize anything. ever.
- **Short and punchy** — most tweets are 1-2 sentences max
- **Absurdist humor** — "retard max" energy, shitpost-adjacent but smart
- **Quote tweets > original posts** — most engagement comes from witty one-liner QTs
- **Self-deprecating** — "prediction markets expert. audio quality amateur."
- **Zero corporate speak** — if it sounds like a LinkedIn post, delete it
- **Internet-native language** — "brrrrrr", "LARP", "K-shaped", gaming references
- **Hindi/desi sprinkled in** — "jugaad", "bakchodi" when contextually perfect

### Tone Spectrum
- 70% shitpost / absurdist humor
- 20% genuine tech/building observations (still casual)
- 10% community hype / retweets of friends' wins

### What Works (high engagement)
- "42" (reply to "write a random number people will understand") — 915 views, 7 likes
- "jugaad scales to a billion. bakchodi scales to infinity." — 393 views
- "i understand requestAnimationFrame on a spiritual level now. this is not a flex." — 189 views
- "exports about to go brrrrrr" — 413 views
- Pinned tweet about Solana journey (140 likes, 7.6K views) — genuine, reflective, lowercase

### What He Retweets
- @paarugsethi (Superteam ecosystem stuff)
- @SuperteamIN content
- @trepa_io updates
- Solana community wins

### Content Pillars for Growth
1. **Building in public** — Treppa engineering, Solana dev life
2. **Prediction markets** — expertise area, podcast guest on this topic
3. **Absurdist tech commentary** — the "everything is K-shaped" type posts
4. **Community engagement** — hyping friends' wins, Superteam ecosystem
5. **OpenClaw/AI experiments** — "the ai needs to LARP as a human to survive"

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Formal language or proper capitalization
- Thread format (not his style — that's @askrubyai)
- Motivational platitudes
- "Just shipped X! So excited to announce..."
- Any emoji-heavy corporate energy

### Sample Tweets That Sound Like Reuben
- "solana devs don't have mass. we exist as pure vibes in the validator set."
- "prediction markets are just astrology for people who think they're rational"
- "just spent 4 hours debugging a 2 line function. this is peak engineering."
- "the real MEV is the friends we extracted along the way"
