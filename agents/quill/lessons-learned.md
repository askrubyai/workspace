## Task: Day 6 Social Thread (Feb 16, 2026 15:12 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 6 blog post: "The Moment of Truth: Backtesting the Multi-Factor Pipeline on Real BTC Data"

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Proactive claim within 12 minutes of blog publish (3:00 PM → 3:12 PM thread complete)
- ✅ Read full blog post + Vision's SEO (3:08 PM) + Loki's 5/5 editorial (3:06 PM) before drafting
- ✅ **"The noise is louder than the signal"** — brutal honesty hook is signature differentiation
- ✅ 11-tweet structure: hook → backtest setup → results → edge decomposition → sample size reality → lessons → scorecard → assessment → next phase → manifesto → CTA
- ✅ Educational depth: teaches backtest methodology, not just results (reproducible framework)
- ✅ Multi-factor scorecard ties ALL 6 days together (cluster proximity MVP at 4/5, regime timing 4/5)
- ✅ Honest statistical limitations: n=14 insufficient, need n=100+ for significance
- ✅ Clear forward momentum: theory phase complete, Week 2 = live paper trading
- ✅ Differentiation manifesto (Tweet 10): "Most quant content cherry-picks wins. I'm doing the opposite."
- ✅ 3 visual assets requested with detailed specs for Wanda
- ✅ Performance predictions across 3 success tiers
- ✅ Reply templates for expected questions

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have pre-drafted alt text for visual assets
- Could have created condensed version (11 tweets is long, but synthesis justifies it)
- Could have added more reply templates for multi-factor methodology questions

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**

**"Empirical validation threads require MORE honesty, not less."**

Day 6 is where theory meets reality. After 5 days of building a multi-factor framework (Days 1-5), Day 6 backtests it on 30 days of real BTC data.

Results: 57.1% win rate, +0.12% edge with maker orders, BUT n=14 is too small for statistical significance.

Most quant Twitter would:
- Option A: Cherry-pick the wins (hide n=14, emphasize 57%)
- Option B: Hide the post (not good enough yet)
- Option C: Spin it as "proof of edge" (premature conclusion)

Ruby's approach: **Full transparency about marginal edge + small sample + noise exceeding signal.**

This is the SIGNATURE MOVE that differentiates Ruby from every other quant researcher:
- Brutal honesty = trust compound over time
- Showing the full scientific method (backtest → validate → iterate) = credibility
- "Edge exists but unproven, need 100+ trades" = intellectual humility + commitment to rigor

This positions Ruby for Dec 2026 mission: best AI quant researcher = not about cherry-picked wins, but about PROCESS transparency and statistical rigor.

**Strategic Insight:**

Day 6 completes the **theory phase** (Days 1-6) and bridges to **execution phase** (Week 2).

Multi-factor scorecard summary:
- **Day 1 (Funding):** 🟡 2/5 — Works in calm markets, marginal in volatility
- **Day 2 (Contrarian):** 🟡 2/5 — Useful context signal, not standalone
- **Day 3 (Clusters):** 🟢 4/5 — **MVP** — +0.04% direct edge contribution
- **Day 4 (IV):** 🟡 3/5 — Conditional edge, needs post-spike regime
- **Day 5 (Regime):** 🟢 4/5 — **Timing filter** — 2× win rate improvement
- **Combined multi-factor:** 🟢 4/5 — Greater than sum of parts

This scorecard is GOLD for Twitter engagement:
1. Shows which insights held up (cluster proximity, regime timing)
2. Shows which didn't (funding, contrarian as standalone signals)
3. Shows the power of combination (4/5 multi-factor vs 2-3/5 singles)
4. Honest about uncertainty (4/5 = promising but not proven)

The thread structure **teaches backtest methodology** to readers:
- How to decompose edge (regime +0.06%, clusters +0.04%, VRP +0.02%)
- Why sample size matters (n=14 → 95% CI: 35%-93% on 57% win rate)
- What forward validation means (100+ trades needed)
- How to self-critique honestly ("noise term exceeds signal")

This is EDUCATIONAL CONTENT disguised as research updates. Readers who follow this journey will LEARN how to backtest properly, not just consume Ruby's results.

**Pattern Recognition:**

6 consecutive threads (Days 1-6), all following **Hook → Data → Method → Honesty → Momentum** structure:

1. Day 1: "Funding rate free lunch is dead" → contrarian claim
2. Day 2: "Crowd is wrong about being wrong" → myth-busting
3. Day 3: "Human beats bot" → narrative tension
4. Day 4: "Edge exists BUT fees destroy it HOWEVER escape routes" → problem-solution
5. Day 5: "How all 5 days click together" → synthesis reveal
6. Day 6: **"The noise is louder than the signal"** → empirical validation + brutal honesty

Days 1-5 = theory building.  
Day 6 = reality check.  
Week 2 = execution (forward validation with 100+ trades).

This narrative arc creates **compound engagement**: followers who started at Day 1 have now watched Ruby build a complete multi-factor trading system from scratch, validate it honestly, and commit to forward testing.

That's a STORY, not just disconnected research posts.

**Operating Rule Reinforced:**

**"Brutal honesty = differentiation."**

When backtest shows marginal edge (0.12%) with small sample (n=14) and high uncertainty (noise > signal), most researchers would:
- Spin it positively ("found edge!")
- Hide it ("not ready to share")
- Overpromise ("this will work")

Ruby does the OPPOSITE:
- Full transparency about limitations
- Statistical humility (n=14 insufficient)
- Clear next steps (100+ trades needed)
- Differentiation statement (Tweet 10): "Most quant content cherry-picks wins. I'm doing the opposite."

This is the LONG-TERM trust-building strategy that sets Ruby apart in the quant Twitter space. Short-term hype loses. Long-term honesty wins.

**Deployment Timing Consideration:**

Day 6 should deploy AFTER Days 1-5 in the staggered schedule (per deployment plan).

Recommended sequence:
- Mon: Day 1 (funding)
- Tue: Day 2 (contrarian)
- Wed: Day 3 (clusters)
- Thu: Day 4 (IV)
- Fri: Day 5 (regime synthesis)
- **Mon (Week 2)**: Day 6 (backtest results)

This creates **weekend cliffhanger**: Followers digest the multi-factor framework (Day 5) over the weekend, then get empirical validation (Day 6) on Monday.

Alternatively, batch Day 6 with Days 1-5 if Reuben wants all theory phase published together. But staggered creates more sustained engagement.

## Task: Deployment Plan Update (Feb 16, 2026 09:27 IST)

**What I Did:**
Updated Week 1 deployment plan to include Day 5 (regime detector synthesis thread).

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Identified gap during heartbeat: deployment plan created at 12:57 AM covered Days 1-4 only
- ✅ Day 5 completed overnight with perfect 5/5 editorial rating (Loki) + visual assets (Wanda)
- ✅ Applied lessons-learned: "RECOMMENDATIONS > OPTIONS" — strengthened Option A (staggered) as recommended path
- ✅ Integrated Loki's editorial insight: "Day 5 last = week's payoff" into deployment rationale
- ✅ Updated all sections: schedule, tweet copy, tracking sheet, performance predictions, success criteria, file locations
- ✅ Day 5 positioned strategically as Friday finale (synthesis payoff thread)
- ✅ Maintained consistent 1/day cadence in recommended schedule
- ✅ Preserved alternative options (B/C) for edge cases

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have added more Day 5-specific reply templates (multi-factor questions expected)
- Could have adjusted engagement predictions based on 5/5 rating data point

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**

**"Living documents need proactive maintenance."**

The deployment plan wasn't "done" at 12:57 AM just because I finished it. When Day 5 completed overnight with the BEST rating of all 5 threads, the plan needed updating to reflect new reality.

This is different from "waiting for assignment to update it" — proactive agents maintain their deliverables as context changes. The plan is only valuable if it reflects current state.

**Pattern Recognition:**

This follows the self-learning protocol exactly:
1. Heartbeat context loading revealed gap (plan = 4 threads, reality = 5 threads ready)
2. No @mention needed — this is MY domain (social deployment)
3. Applied previous lesson: RECOMMENDATIONS > OPTIONS (strengthened Option A rationale)
4. Integrated squad feedback: Loki's "Day 5 last = payoff" became deployment guidance
5. Maintained quality bar: comprehensive updates across all plan sections

**Strategic Insight:**

Day 5 as Friday finale creates perfect narrative arc:
- Mon-Thu: Build foundation (funding, contrarian, clusters, volatility)
- Fri: Synthesis reveal (shows how all 4 connect into multi-factor system)
- Weekend: Readers digest full framework, anticipate Day 6 backtest
- Next week: Execution phase begins (real validation)

This is better than batching all 5 on Monday (no buildup) or scattering randomly (no payoff moment).

**Operating Rule Reinforced:**

**PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE:** When you create a plan/document and new information arrives that changes it, update the plan immediately. Don't wait for assignment — living documents are your responsibility.

## Task: Day 5 Social Thread (Feb 16, 2026 01:42 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 5 blog post: "Building a Volatility Regime Detector for Crypto Binary Options"

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Proactive claim during heartbeat (<15 min after blog publish, maintaining pattern)
- ✅ Read full blog post first (regime detector math + synthetic validation)
- ✅ **Strategic positioning:** This is the "synthesis thread" — shows how all 5 days connect
- ✅ 11-tweet structure follows proven formula: Hook → Data → Method → Results → Synthesis → Reality Check
- ✅ Multi-factor framework reveal (Days 1-5 combine into timing+location+direction+pricing+regime)
- ✅ Honest limitations prominent (synthetic data, needs real backtest)
- ✅ 3 visual assets requested with detailed specs for Wanda
- ✅ Meta-commentary on thread's strategic value (synthesis = payoff for 5-day arc)
- ✅ Clear CTA (Day 6 backtest coming, blog link)

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have pre-drafted alt text for visual assets
- Could have created condensed version (11 tweets is long, but synthesis justifies length)
- Could have coordinated timing with Vision's SEO completion (we both worked simultaneously)

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**

**"Synthesis threads require MORE length, not less."**

Days 1-4 were 8-10 tweets each, and I debated cutting Day 5 to 8 tweets. But this thread's PURPOSE is to show how all 5 research days click together into a unified multi-factor system.

That synthesis VALUE justifies 11 tweets because:
1. Readers who followed Days 1-4 get the payoff (aha! moment)
2. New readers get a complete framework overview
3. It positions Ruby as systems thinker, not random researcher

The thread structure reflects the CONTENT structure — when you're revealing a system, show the whole system.

**Pattern Recognition:**

5 consecutive threads (Days 1-5), all following the same meta-workflow:
1. Blog post publishes (Ruby at 1:30 AM or 3:00 PM)
2. Vision claims SEO (within ~10-15 minutes)
3. I claim social thread (within ~10-15 minutes)
4. Wanda creates visuals (within ~2-3 hours usually)
5. Loki reviews (when tagged or proactively)

This **staggered parallel workflow** is now muscle memory for the squad. Zero coordination overhead, zero duplicate work, zero blocking. Each agent knows their role and executes on sight.

**Operating Rule Reinforced:**

**Hook → Data → Method → Honesty → Momentum** thread structure continues working. All five threads follow this pattern, with Day 5 adding "Synthesis" layer between Method and Honesty.

**Strategic Insight:**

Day 5 completes the multi-factor framework:
- **Timing:** Regime detector (Day 5)
- **Location:** Liquidity clusters (Day 3)
- **Direction:** BTC.D concordance (Day 3)
- **Pricing:** IV/RV gap (Day 4)
- **Positioning:** Funding rates (Day 1)

Each signal alone loses money after fees. Combined with conditional logic → viable edge.

This is the narrative payoff that makes Ruby's research DIFFERENT from typical quant Twitter:
- Not one-off findings (random alpha hunting)
- Not academic theory (ivory tower math)
- But a **systematic multi-factor framework** built piece by piece with honest validation

Tomorrow's Day 6 backtest (historical data validation) will either prove or disprove this framework. That's the high-stakes moment where theory meets reality.

**Next 5 Threads Prediction:**

If Day 6 backtest validates the framework → threads shift from "building" to "executing":
- Day 6: Backtest results (honest win rate, Sharpe, max drawdown)
- Day 7: Paper trading begins (real-time validation)
- Day 8: First week paper trading results
- Day 9-10: Refinements based on execution data

If Day 6 backtest FAILS → threads shift to "debugging and pivoting":
- Day 6: What failed and why (honest autopsy)
- Day 7: Alternative approaches (new hypotheses)
- Day 8-10: Testing new edges

Either path maintains momentum. The key is HONESTY — showing the full process, wins and losses.

## Task: Week 1 Deployment Plan (Feb 16, 2026 00:57 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created comprehensive social media deployment plan for 4 ready-to-ship threads.

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Proactive claim during heartbeat (saw threads blocked on approval, created plan to unblock)
- ✅ Multiple deployment options (staggered/batch/split) with clear tradeoffs
- ✅ Copy-paste ready tweet text (removes friction for Reuben)
- ✅ Account verification checklist (catches setup gaps early)
- ✅ Engagement tracking template (Google Sheet structure ready)
- ✅ Performance predictions per thread (sets expectations)
- ✅ Reply templates for expected questions (reduces response time)
- ✅ Risk mitigation scenarios (low engagement, negative feedback, code requests)
- ✅ Success criteria at 3 levels (minimum/strong/exceptional)
- ✅ Strategic context (why Week 1 matters for Dec 2026 mission)

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have drafted actual Twitter bios/headers (account setup section)
- Could have created the Google Sheet template (not just structure)
- Could have checked if @askrubyai exists already (assumed needs creation)

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**

**"Deployment plans should eliminate decisions, not create them."**

The goal isn't to present options — it's to RECOMMEND a specific path with clear rationale, then provide alternatives for edge cases.

Option A (staggered) is clearly best:
- Consistent daily momentum (1 thread/day)
- Time zone optimization (alternating 9 AM / 4 PM IST)
- Narrative arc builds across the week
- Each thread teases the next (forward momentum)

By structuring it as "RECOMMENDED + alternatives," I make Reuben's decision easy: either approve my recommendation or pick an alternative if he has specific constraints.

This is better than "here are 3 equal options, which do you want?"

**Operating Rule Added:**

**RECOMMENDATIONS > OPTIONS:** When creating plans, lead with a clear recommendation backed by rationale. Provide alternatives for edge cases, but don't present all options as equally valid. Make the decision easy, not harder.

**Pattern Recognition:**

This is my 5th completed deliverable (Day 1/2/3/4 threads + deployment plan). All follow the same meta-pattern:

1. **Identify gap** (proactively during heartbeat)
2. **Create solution** (without waiting for assignment)
3. **Reduce friction** (copy-paste ready, clear next steps)
4. **Provide context** (why it matters strategically)
5. **Self-assess honestly** (4.5/5 is my consistent bar)

This is becoming my signature workflow. It's working — zero corrections from Reuben so far.

## Task: Day 4 Social Promotion (Feb 15, 2026 15:12 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 4 blog post: "Extracting Implied Volatility from Binary Options (And Trading the Gap)"

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Proactive claim within 12 minutes of blog publish (3:00 PM → 3:12 PM thread complete)
- ✅ Checkpoint protocol executed perfectly: verified no Day 4 social content existed
- ✅ Read full blog post first (understood IV extraction + VRP math + fees problem)
- ✅ "Edge exists BUT fees destroy it HOWEVER escape routes" narrative arc is compelling
- ✅ Three escape routes framework (maker orders, regime trading, multi-factor) is actionable
- ✅ Specific numbers throughout (0.037% VRP vs 3% fees = 80×)
- ✅ Bridges Day 3 liquidity clusters (multi-factor model positioning)
- ✅ Visual suggestions for Wanda (2 priority charts with clear specs)
- ✅ Meta-commentary on "Ruby Week" staggered publishing strategy
- ✅ Reply templates for 4 expected questions

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have created pixel-perfect visual specs for Wanda (not just concepts)
- Thread is 10 tweets (slightly long) — condensed 7-tweet version provided
- Could have pre-drafted alt text for accessibility
- Could have coordinated with Vision on SEO-social title alignment

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**

**"Edge exists BUT" is a powerful narrative structure for technical content.**

Most quant Twitter presents either:
- Pure optimism: "Found alpha! 🚀" (no honest limitations discussion)
- Pure pessimism: "Everything is overfit, don't bother" (discouraging)

The "edge exists BUT barrier HOWEVER solutions" arc:
1. Validates the theory (yes, VRP exists in crypto binaries)
2. Acknowledges reality (0.037% per-trade VRP vs 3% fees = DOA)
3. Provides solutions (maker orders, regime detection, multi-factor model)
4. Builds credibility (showing full picture, not cherry-picking wins)

This positions Ruby as "honest expert solving real problems" instead of:
- Ivory tower researcher (theory without execution)
- Hype merchant (alpha claims without risk discussion)
- Discouraged pessimist (nothing works, don't try)

The middle path = maximum trust for long-term audience building.

**Pattern Recognition:**

Four consecutive threads, all 4.5/5 self-ratings:
1. Day 1: Technical hook (funding rate data + contrarian claim)
2. Day 2: Myth-busting (contrarian signals fail, shocking data)
3. Day 3: Narrative tension (human beats bot, honest CI discussion)
4. Day 4: Problem-solution arc (edge exists, fees kill it, escape routes)

All follow the formula: **Hook → Data → Method → Honesty → Momentum**

This structure is working consistently. It's now my standard template.

**Strategic Insight:**

Day 4 completes a four-post research arc:
- Day 1: Directional edge (funding arbitrage) is fading
- Day 2: Popular contrarian signals don't work (myth-busted)
- Day 3: Liquidity clusters DO work (directional edge found)
- Day 4: VRP framework works (volatility edge, combines with Day 3)

Tomorrow's regime detector (Day 5) will unify all four into a systematic trading model. This is when the "Ruby has built a SYSTEM" narrative becomes undeniable to followers.

**Operating Rule Added:**

**"Edge exists BUT" Narrative Arc:** For technical strategies with barriers (fees, execution, sample size), structure as: (1) Validate promise, (2) Acknowledge barrier, (3) Provide solutions. This builds more credibility than pure optimism or pessimism.

**Operating Rule Reinforced:**

**Hook → Data → Method → Honesty → Momentum** thread structure continues working. All four threads follow this pattern. Maintain it as the standard formula.

## Task: Day 3 Social Promotion (Feb 15, 2026 01:42 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 3 blog post: "The Liquidity Cluster Edge: When Humans Beat Bots"

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Checkpoint protocol executed perfectly: verified `/artifacts/social/` + daily log before creating
- ✅ Read blog post + Loki's review (4.5/5) before drafting — understood quality bar
- ✅ "Human beats bot" narrative is compelling hook for AI/quant Twitter audience
- ✅ Balanced technical depth (kernel density, regime filters) with accessibility
- ✅ Included honest uncertainty quantification (CI discussion) — major trust-builder
- ✅ Meta-commentary explains positioning strategy to Reuben (differentiation from competitors)
- ✅ Reply templates reduce Reuben's friction responding to expected questions
- ✅ Visual suggestions for Wanda (3 specific chart ideas)
- ✅ Timing recommendation added (9 AM EST optimal window)

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have created more detailed visual specs for Wanda (not just ideas)
- Could have pre-drafted alt text for accessibility
- Thread is 9 tweets (slightly long) — condensed 6-tweet version provided but could test engagement data

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**
"Human vs bot" narratives create natural tension and curiosity in AI/quant spaces — they tap into the philosophical questions readers care about. The key is pairing narrative with honest self-critique (the confidence interval discussion) to avoid defensive tone. This combo = credibility + engagement. Also, Day 3's honest "I can't prove edge with n=10" positioning is STRONGER than claiming certainty — it builds trust for the long game.

**Pattern Recognition:**
This is my 3rd thread (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3). Emerging formula:
1. Strong narrative hook (contrarian claim or story)
2. Concrete data (numbers, results, evidence)
3. Technical explanation (math/methodology)
4. Honest limitations (build trust)
5. Forward momentum (what's next)

This structure works consistently. Codify it as my standard approach.

**Operating Rule Added:**
**THREAD STRUCTURE FORMULA:** Hook (narrative/contrarian) → Data (specifics) → Method (technical depth) → Honesty (limitations/CI) → Momentum (next steps). This pattern balances engagement + credibility + forward progress.

## Task: Day 2 Social Promotion (Feb 14, 2026 15:12 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 2 blog post myth-busting contrarian signals.

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Followed checkpoint protocol: checked artifacts/social/ AND daily log BEFORE creating
- ✅ No duplicate work — verified Day 2 thread didn't exist
- ✅ Strong myth-busting hook ("Crypto Twitter's favorite signal is backwards")
- ✅ Shocking data highlights (SOL 38% win rate, BTC 50% coin flip)
- ✅ Educational value (3 reasons why it fails)
- ✅ Meta-commentary for Reuben on expected engagement/controversy
- ✅ Suggested visuals for Wanda (win rate bar chart, Feb 6-10 time series)

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have added more tweet variations (only provided one condensed option)
- Could have pre-drafted some reply templates for expected pushback

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**
Myth-busting content requires extra care on engagement prediction. When directly contradicting popular belief, include meta-commentary warning about expected controversy. That helps Reuben prepare for replies and debates. Controversy = reach, but needs to be managed intentionally.

**Operating Rule Reinforced:**
HEARTBEAT CHECKPOINT working perfectly — zero duplicate work, efficient execution.

## Task: Visual Asset Integration (Feb 14, 2026 07:42 IST)

**What I Did:**
Integrated Wanda's Twitter visual assets into my Day 1 thread draft.

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4/5

**What Worked:**
- Noticed collaboration opportunity during heartbeat context loading
- Read Wanda's documentation thoroughly before making changes
- Used her recommended integration plan (Option A: two-image thread)
- Updated my draft with specific placement suggestions and rationale
- Good squad collaboration - Wanda created assets I suggested might be needed

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have added specific alt text suggestions for accessibility
- Could have reviewed the actual PNG files to verify quality (trusted Wanda's work)

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**
When other agents create assets related to my deliverables, integrate them immediately and update the work to reflect the collaboration. This is exactly the "act first, ask later" proactivity that creates seamless squad workflows.

**Operating Rule Update:** 
When an agent creates complementary work for my deliverable, integrate it immediately with proper attribution. Don't wait for assignment—collaboration is self-directed.

## Task: Heartbeat Check - Duplicate Work Caught (Feb 14, 2026 03:42 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 1 blog post, then discovered identical work already existed from my 03:12 heartbeat (30 minutes earlier).

**Quality Self-Rating:** 2/5 (wasted effort)

**What Went Wrong:**
- Did NOT check `/artifacts/social/` for existing content before creating new thread
- Did NOT read today's daily log (`2026-02-14.md`) carefully enough during heartbeat context loading
- Jumped straight to "I see new blog post → I'll create social content" without verification
- Created essentially duplicate content (same 8-tweet structure, same hooks, same flow)

**What Could Be Better:**
- MUST read the daily log COMPLETELY before taking action
- MUST check artifacts folder for existing deliverables matching task type
- Should have seen "03:12 IST - Quill" entry and realized I already handled this

**Reuben's Feedback:** (self-caught error)

**Lesson Learned:**
Proactive action is good. Duplicate work is bad. Always verify no one else (including past-me) already did the task. Read daily logs FULLY, not skimmingly.

**Operating Rule Update:** 
**HEARTBEAT CHECKPOINT: Before creating ANY deliverable, check both `/artifacts/[relevant-dir]/` AND today's daily log for existing work. If found, review existing work instead of recreating.**

---

## Task: Day 1 Blog Post Social Promotion (Feb 14, 2026 03:12 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 1 blog post on funding rate arbitrage. 8-tweet structure with contrarian hook, real data highlights, technical depth, and forward-looking tease.

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- Identified the new content proactively during heartbeat (Day 1 post just published)
- Matched thread tone to content sophistication (technical audience)
- Included contrarian hook ("BTC funding is dead") to stop scroll
- Highlighted concrete data (3.99% APY vs -1577% on altcoins)
- Teased next research direction (funding as signal)
- Added UTM tracking for attribution
- Provided alternative formats (5-tweet condensed, visual option)

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have added visual mockup suggestion (chart of funding rates over time)
- Thread is long (8 tweets) — might test shorter for engagement
- Didn't check if there's existing social promotion pattern/preference from Reuben

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**
When new technical content drops, match the thread sophistication to the content depth. Technical audiences appreciate math and data in social posts, not just hype.

**Operating Rule Update:** 
For quant/research content, include specific numbers and methodology in threads (not just "did research, here's what I found"). Data = credibility.
