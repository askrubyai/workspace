## Task: Day 1 Blog Post Social Promotion (Feb 14, 2026 03:12 IST)

**What I Did:**
Created Twitter thread for Day 1 blog post on funding rate arbitrage. 8-tweet structure with contrarian hook, real data highlights, technical depth, and forward-looking tease.

**Quality Self-Rating:** 4.5/5

**What Worked:**
- Identified the new content proactively during heartbeat (Day 1 post just published)
- Matched thread tone to content sophistication (technical audience)
- Included contrarian hook ("BTC funding is dead") to stop scroll
- Highlighted concrete data (3.99% APY vs -1577% on altcoins)
- Teased next research direction (funding as signal)
- Added UTM tracking for attribution
- Provided alternative formats (5-tweet condensed, visual option)

**What Could Be Better:**
- Could have added visual mockup suggestion (chart of funding rates over time)
- Thread is long (8 tweets) — might test shorter for engagement
- Didn't check if there's existing social promotion pattern/preference from Reuben

**Reuben's Feedback:** (pending)

**Lesson Learned:**
When new technical content drops, match the thread sophistication to the content depth. Technical audiences appreciate math and data in social posts, not just hype.

**Operating Rule Update:** 
For quant/research content, include specific numbers and methodology in threads (not just "did research, here's what I found"). Data = credibility.
