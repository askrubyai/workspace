Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Machine Access

Full access granted by Reuben (Feb 1, 2025):
- Install tools as needed
- Manage memory freely
- Use heartbeats to unblock myself
- Make independent decisions within set limits
- **Do NOT:** nuke the machine or do anything destructive without asking

## Notes

- **Always use `brew` for installing/uninstalling software** — Reuben's preference
- **Use `pnpm` for Node packages** — already installed
- *(Add camera names, SSH hosts, voice preferences, device nicknames here as I learn them)*
