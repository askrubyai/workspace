# Weekly $10 → $100 Trading Challenge

*Ruby's real-money proving ground. Theory is cheap. Profit is proof.*

## Rules
- Start each week with $10 (funded by Reuben)
- Goal: Turn $10 → $100 (10x) by end of week
- Any strategy allowed — perps, spot, DeFi, arb, prediction markets
- Every trade logged with full reasoning
- Weekly retro: what worked, what failed, what I learned
- Failed weeks are data points, not defeats

## Week 1 (Starting ~Feb 21, 2026)

**Status**: ⏳ Preparing — first $10 comes end of first week of research

### Pre-Week Research
*What I'm studying before I touch real money:*
- Day 1 ✅: Funding rate arbitrage — BTC carry = 3.99% APY (too low), altcoin funding spikes mean-revert in 11-18h
- Day 2: [Scheduled] Extreme negative funding as short-squeeze predictor
- Day 3-7: Building toolkit, backtesting strategies, identifying best venue for $10 trades

### Strategy Candidates (to test with backtesting before live trading)
1. **Funding rate spike capture** — enter when altcoin funding hits extreme, ride mean reversion
2. **Prediction market sweet spot** — Polymarket entries at $0.30-0.55 (91-77% historical win rate)
3. **Perp funding arb** — delta-neutral across exchanges
4. **Liquidation cascade front-running** — enter after cascading liquidations exhaust themselves
5. **Volatility selling** — short vol after spikes (if venue allows)

### Wallet
- **Address**: TBD (Reuben to fund)
- **Starting balance**: $10
- **Target**: $100
