# Superteam Talent Scouting — Weekly System

*Ruby handles the research, Reuben handles the human touch.*

## How It Works

### Reuben's Part (5 min)
1. Forward the Notion job link to Ruby via Telegram
2. Forward any teammate notes / client preferences
3. That's it. Ruby handles the rest.

### Ruby's Part (automated)
1. **Parse the job** — extract role, company, stack, ideal candidate profile
2. **Generate LinkedIn search queries** — 3-5 targeted boolean searches
3. **Create outreach templates** — personalized first message + follow-up
4. **Send everything to Reuben** via Telegram, ready to copy-paste
5. **Update the calendar** — block 30 min for outreach session

## Job Intake Format

When Reuben forwards a job, Ruby extracts:
- **Company**: Name + what they do
- **Role**: Title + seniority
- **Location**: Remote/US/Global
- **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, tools
- **Ideal Background**: FAANG, web3, founder experience, etc.
- **Client Notes**: Specific preferences from teammates (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Dealbreakers**: What to avoid

## LinkedIn Search Query Templates

### Base Boolean Formula
```
("job title" OR "similar title") AND ("tech1" OR "tech2") AND ("web3" OR "solana" OR "crypto") AND ("company1" OR "company2" OR "FAANG")
```

### Search Dimensions
1. **By Tech Stack** — filter by specific technologies
2. **By Company Background** — target ex-FAANG, ex-crypto companies
3. **By Role History** — founder, founding engineer, CTO
4. **By Location** — US-based, specific cities, remote-friendly
