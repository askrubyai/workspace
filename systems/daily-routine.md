## Fitness Plan: Beginner Home Workout (No Equipment)

### Week 1-2: Foundation
**3x per week** (Mon/Wed/Fri or any 3 days with rest between)

**Warm-up (3 min)**
- Jumping jacks: 30 seconds
- Arm circles (forward + backward): 30 seconds each
- Hip rotations: 30 seconds
- High knees: 30 seconds

**Circuit (repeat 3x, rest 60s between rounds)**
1. Push-ups: 10 reps (knee push-ups if needed)
2. Bodyweight squats: 15 reps
3. Plank: 30 seconds
4. Reverse lunges: 10 each leg
5. Mountain climbers: 20 seconds

**Cool-down (3 min)**
- Quad stretch: 30 sec each leg
- Hamstring stretch: 30 sec each leg
- Chest/shoulder stretch: 30 sec
- Child's pose: 30 sec

**Total time: ~25 minutes**

### Week 3-4: Build
Same structure, increase:
- Push-ups → 15 reps
- Squats → 20 reps
- Plank → 45 seconds
- Lunges → 12 each leg
- Mountain climbers → 30 seconds
- Add: Burpees 5 reps per round

### Week 5-6: Level Up
- Push-ups → 20 reps (try diamond push-ups for 5)
- Add: Pike push-ups 8 reps (shoulders)
- Squats → jump squats 15 reps
- Plank → 60 seconds
- Add: Superman holds 30 seconds (back)
- 4 rounds instead of 3

### Progression Rules
1. If you can complete all sets easily → increase reps by 5 or add 1 round
2. If form breaks down → stay at current level another week
3. Consistency > intensity. 3x 25-min sessions beats 1x 90-min session
4. Rest days are growth days. Don't skip them.

## Ruby's Role
- Morning reminder with today's workout
- Track completed workouts in daily notes
- Adjust plan based on feedback
- Research new exercises/progressions as needed
- Weekly check-in: how's the body feeling?
