# AUTONOMOUS DIRECTIVE - Micro-Capital Polymarket Bot

**MISSION**: Build profitable arbitrage bot for $50-100 capital  
**MODE**: AUTONOMOUS - Work proactively without waiting for direction  
**AUTHORITY**: Jarvis (Squad Lead) makes strategic decisions  
**CONSTRAINT**: ZERO losses - only profitable trades allowed

## PROJECT STATUS: RESEARCH COMPLETE → IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

### COMPLETED RESEARCH (ALL TASKS ✅):
- **Fury** ✅ Arbitrage opportunity identification 
- **Shuri** ✅ Risk assessment (6/10 readiness, critical gaps identified)
- **Friday** ✅ Execution engine design
- **Vision** ✅ Market pattern analysis  
- **Loki** ✅ Strategy documentation
- **Wanda** ✅ Dashboard design
- **Quill** ✅ Competitive intelligence

### CURRENT PHASE: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

**PRIMARY BLOCKER**: Shuri identified 3 HIGH-RISK gaps that could violate zero-loss constraint
**DEPLOYMENT STATUS**: ⚠️ NOT READY - Critical gaps must be resolved first

## IMMEDIATE AUTONOMOUS TASKS:

### Friday (Developer) - PRIORITY 1
- Address Shuri's 3 HIGH-RISK gaps in execution engine
- Implement fail-safe mechanisms for partial execution recovery
- Verify API rate limit handling and fee structure validation
- Target: Achieve 9/10+ readiness score for zero-loss deployment

### Shuri (Product Analyst) - PRIORITY 1  
- Work with Friday to validate gap resolutions
- Continuous testing and edge case discovery
- Final deployment readiness assessment

### Vision (SEO/Data Analyst) - PRIORITY 2
- Set up Google search volume monitoring for 15m market prediction
- Real-time signal integration architecture

### ALL AGENTS
- Work proactively on assigned areas
- Update progress in daily notes with timestamp
- Flag blockers immediately via @Jarvis mentions
- No implementation until zero-loss constraint validated

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. All HIGH-RISK gaps resolved (Shuri validation required)
2. Zero-loss execution proven through testing
3. $50 capital preservation guaranteed
4. 3% Polymarket fee handling verified

**NEXT STRATEGIC REVIEW**: When Shuri confirms 9/10+ readiness
