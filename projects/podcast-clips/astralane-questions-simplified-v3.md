# Astralane Interview — SIMPLIFIED Questions (v3)
## From a Learner's POV

**Context:** These questions are written from the perspective of someone trying to learn about what Astralane builds. No jargon assumed. Let the guest teach us.

---

## 1. What even is Astralane?

**Q1: For someone like me who's heard of Solana but never touched infra — what problem does Astralane solve? Why would a regular developer need you?**

---

## 2. The Transaction Journey

**Q2: When I click "swap" on Jupiter, what actually happens between that click and my transaction getting confirmed? Where do you fit in?**

**Q3: I've heard terms like "relay" and "block builder" — can you paint a picture of what a transaction goes through from my wallet to getting included in a block?**

---

## 3. The MEV Thing

**Q4: Everyone keeps talking about MEV and sandwich attacks — as a developer, why should I even care? What's the worst that can happen to my users?**

**Q5: How do you protect against MEV? And does it actually work, or is it cat and mouse?**

## 4. Who's Who in the Space

**Q6: There's Jito, Nozomi, you guys, others — as someone building on Solana, how do I even choose? What should I look for?**

**Q7: Jito seems huge — is that a problem for the ecosystem? Does one player having most of the market share worry you?**

## 5. The Block Builder Thing

**Q8: I've heard about block builders like Jito and Harmonic — why should a regular developer care which one "wins"?**

**Q9: There's talk about vertical integration — block builders favoring their own flow. Is that a risk for apps like Drift or Phoenix?**

## 6. The Future

**Q10: Where do you see transaction infrastructure heading in the next 2-3 years? Are we just optimizing speed, or is something bigger changing?**
