## CLIP 1: "He Built an Insurance Protocol. Then He Realized MEV Was Stealing His Orders." ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### The Story (1-2 sentences)
A crypto founder's journey from a failed algo stablecoin → insurance protocol → discovering his orders were being stolen by MEV searchers → building Astralane to solve transaction routing.

### Timestamps
**Full Arc:** [05:56] → [07:00] (~64 seconds)
**Suggested Edit:** [05:56] → [06:45] (~49 seconds)

### Key Moments
- [05:56] "We were trying to predict something and then they were trying to overbid that and then cause the exploit again"
- [06:25] "We started building some of the current stack under Astralane back in 2022 when we were experimenting with MEV infrastructure"
- [06:39] "There were people even seeing those transactions and overbidding us by copying our transaction"

### Suggested Titles (Solana Dev Focus)
1. **"He learned about MEV the hard way — now he processes 3 million trades a day"**
2. "How MEV searchers stole his insurance protocol's orders"
3. "The founder who accidentally discovered MEV while building insurance"

### Why This Works
- ✅ **Relatable pain point** — Every DeFi builder has faced MEV
- ✅ **Numbers proof** — 2-3M trades/day credibility
- ✅ **Origin story arc** — Problem → Discovery → Solution
- ✅ **Solana-specific** — Directly relevant to Solana traders

## CLIP 3: "He Doesn't Care About Your Degree — Here's What He Hires For" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
