## On the MEV/Sandwich Landscape

1. What's the current ratio of tight vs wide sandwiches you're seeing?

2. Can you share data on total MEV extracted over time — is it growing, stable, or declining?

3. How does your MEV protection compare to something like Jito's jitodontfront? And with the shift from tight to wide sandwiches, do you think current protections are actually keeping up?

## On Landing Services Competition

4. What's your market share vs Nozomi, Jito bundles, Helius, etc? Do you have data on how market share has changed over time?

5. How do you differentiate from Nozomi/Jito specifically — on price, execution quality, or protection?

6. What tips do you charge vs competitors and what explains the differential? (Benedict's research showed Nozomi at ~$0.50/swap, Jito at ~$0.01, and Astralane at ~$0.09 per swap)

## On Frontends/Order Flow

7. Do you see execution quality differences across frontends (Axiom vs Jupiter UI vs Photon)? Is one more "MEV-able" than others?

8. Is Axiom's order flow uniquely more toxic or is it an industry-wide problem?

## On Block Builders

9. Do you see any difference in landing rates on Harmonic vs Jito blocks, and any signs of preferential treatment for Nozomi flow on Harmonic blocks? Or is it still too early to tell?

10. If the infrastructure layer ends up vertically integrated, where Harmonic favors flow, does that change how you compete? And more broadly, do you think that kind of vertical integration makes it harder for Solana to develop the neutral microstructure it needs for serious apps like perps and CLOBs?

## On Where Things Are Headed

11. Do you think the current solutions (BAM, Harmonic, Raiku) are adequate before MCP? How do you see these block builders evolving with MCP?

12. Are you working with any apps directly, or is most of your volume coming through frontend integrations? And from the app side, are teams like Drift or Phoenix actively reaching out to landing services, or are they just accepting the status quo?

13. Can you share any data on which protocols or apps your volume comes from?

14. As the validator client landscape gets more diverse, does that complicate things for you? Do you need to integrations for each client build and maintain separate, or is transaction landing mostly client-agnostic from your end?
