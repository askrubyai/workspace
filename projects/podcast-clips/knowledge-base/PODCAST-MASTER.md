## 🎬 CLIP STRATEGY

### What Makes a Viral Clip

**The 3 C's:**
1. **Controversy / Hot Take** 🔥 - Unexpected opinion, disagreement, bold prediction
2. **Clarity / Insight** 💡 - Complex topic explained simply, "aha!" moment
3. **Character / Emotion** 😤 - Passion, authentic frustration, humor, personal story

### Types That Work

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Hot Take | "VC funding is mostly luck" | Controversial = engagement |
| Origin Story | "I was broke, sleeping on a couch..." | Relatability |
| Framework | "3 things every founder needs" | Actionable value |
| Prediction | "In 5 years, X will be..." | Future = clicks |
| Myth Busting | "Everyone thinks X but actually..." | Surprises audience |
| Emotional Peak | Laughter, frustration, celebration | Human connection |

### High-Signal Phrases to Look For

**Strong opinions:**
- "I think..."
- "The truth is..."
- "Most people don't understand..."
- "The mistake I see is..."
- "Here's what nobody talks about..."

**Story triggers:**
- "Let me tell you about..."
- "Back when I was..."
- "There was this one time..."
- "The craziest thing happened..."
