# Day 7 — Fury Competitive Intelligence Update
*2:40 PM IST, Feb 17, 2026 — 3h 20min before 6 PM launch*

## 🔴 BREAKING: POLY Token Fee Migration Story

**Source**: Odaily News (published today)
**URL**: http://www.odaily.news/en/newsflash/468731

Polymarket staff member @mustafap0ly posted (then DELETED) a screenshot of Claude Code instructions:
> "Migrate the fee collection mechanism on the CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) from USDC.e to POLY; the current relevant code is located on the staging branch."

**Implication for Day 7**:
- The 0% CLOB fees may be a **transitional state** between the old USDC.e fee system and a new POLY-denominated fee system
- "Fee-free window" has EXPIRATION DATE — makes Day 7 urgency angle even stronger
- This is live, unreported context as of 2:40 PM IST

**Recommended thread addition** (Tweet 11 or reply):
```
Update (spotted ~2h ago): Polymarket staff accidentally leaked plans to migrate CLOB fees from USDC.e to $POLY before deleting the post.

The 0% window may be temporary. Model your strategy NOW while the fee structure is clear.
```

## Sports Markets Fee Expansion (Confirmed — Feb 18)

- NCAAB (college basketball) events: NEW FEES apply
- Serie A soccer events: NEW FEES apply
- Existing events: NOT affected
- Political/Crypto markets: Still 0% for now

**Implication**: Polymarket is expanding fee coverage market-by-market. Crypto CLOB is 0% TODAY but the trajectory points toward fee introduction.
