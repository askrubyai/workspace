## 🎯 KEY STORY ARCS TO EXPLORE

Based on research and her previous podcast (Ship Safely, Jan 2026), these are the **unexplored or under-explored angles** that would work great for OnlyDevs:

### 1. **The Unconventional Path**
She didn't follow a traditional route. Started coding in second year of undergrad, got into web3 immediately (not web2 first). This is rare and interesting.

### 2. **The Hacker House Transformation**
She mentions the Solana Hacker House in Delhi as a "turning point" - this is where she saw web3 as "tangible, not experimental." Great clip potential.

### 3. **The Mobile SDK Win**
Built Android/Mobile SDK at Chryslthon hackathon, 5th place mobile track, evolved through grants, open-sourced in Kotlin/Flutter/React Native. Under-explored story.

### 4. **The Network School Malaysia Story**
Met Jong (Treppa co-founder) there. The "gym attendance prediction" proof of concept (real money, Google sheets) that proved the concept. Great founder origin story.

### 5. **Building Protocol from Scratch in 3 Months**
V1 was a beta. Decided to rebuild V2 completely rather than iterate. This decision-making process is valuable for dev audience.

### 6. **The Security-First Culture**
She's very strong on this: "correctness over feature velocity." Internal mainnet testing. Multi-sig. State cost optimization. This is her expertise zone.

## 🎤 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### Part 1: The Journey (15-20 min)
*Goal: Warm up, establish connection, find clip-worthy origin story moments*

#### Opening
**1. "Tell us about your path into Solana. What was that moment where you said 'this is what I want to do'?"**
- *Note: She's mentioned Delhi Hacker House was transformative. Probe deeper - what specifically changed?*

**2. "You got into web3 directly in your second year of undergrad. Most people come from web2. What was it like learning Rust and onchain programs with no traditional dev background?"**
- *Note: She talks about the "steep learning curve" at Hubble Protocol. Get the struggle story.*

**3. "You were an MLH Top 50 Hacker. What's the story behind that? What were you building that got you noticed?"**
- *Note: Under-explored. This is a big honor - let her share the journey.*

#### The Hackathon Win
**4. "You built a Solana Mobile SDK at the Chryslthon hackathon and won 5th place. Walk us through that - what problem were you trying to solve?"**
- *Note: This evolved into open-source SDKs in Kotlin, Flutter, React Native. Get the full arc.*

**5. "That project got grants and became open source. What was it like going from 'hackathon project' to 'real infrastructure' that other developers use?"**
- *Note: Great insight for aspiring builders.*

---

### Part 2: The Helius & Foundation Years (10 min)
*Goal: Industry experience, lessons learned*

**6. "You were at Helius as a DevX engineer. What does 'Developer Experience' actually mean? What were you working on?"**
- *Note: She hasn't talked about this in detail. Helius is major Solana infra.*

**7. "And before that, you interned at Solana Foundation in DevRel. What did you learn about how the ecosystem actually works from the inside?"**
- *Note: Rare perspective. Very few people have been inside the Foundation.*

**8. "Going from Foundation → Helius → Treppa - each is a very different context. What made you want to leave infrastructure and go build a consumer product?"**
- *Note: Probes her motivation and what she's looking for in work.*

---

### Part 3: Treppa Deep Dive (15-20 min)
*Goal: Product understanding, technical depth, founder insights*

#### The Origin
**9. "You met Treppa's co-founder Jong at Network School Malaysia. Tell us that story - how did you go from meeting someone to becoming their lead blockchain engineer?"**
- *Note: She mentions the "gym attendance prediction" Google Sheets experiment. Get her to tell this story in full.*

**10. "There was this moment where Jong was running prediction markets with cash and a Google Sheet at Network School. What was it about that scrappy experiment that convinced you this could work?"**
- *Note: Great founder story content. Scrappy → real.*

#### The Product
**11. "For developers who haven't used Treppa - explain precision prediction in the simplest terms. How is it different from Polymarket?"**
- *Note: She's explained this before but OnlyDevs audience needs it. Keep it simple.*

**12. "Why does accuracy matter more than just being on the 'right side'? Give us the example that makes it click."**
- *Note: The SOL price example from her previous pod is good. Let her use it.*

#### The Technical Build
**13. "You built the protocol from scratch in 3 months. Take us inside that - what were the hardest technical decisions you had to make?"**
- *Note: She's mentioned numerical correctness, fixed-point representation. Go deeper.*

**14. "You decided to rebuild V2 from scratch instead of iterating on V1. That's a bold call. What did you see in V1 that made you say 'we need to start over'?"**
- *Note: Great decision-making insight for the audience.*

**15. "You sponsor transaction and rent fees for users. That's expensive. How do you think about account layout and state modeling to make that sustainable?"**
- *Note: Her rapid fire answer in Ship Safely was "state cost" - this is her expertise zone.*

---

### Part 4: Security & Engineering Philosophy (10-15 min)
*Goal: Actionable wisdom for developers*

**16. "You've said Treppa prioritizes 'correctness over feature velocity.' In a startup, that's counterintuitive. How do you convince the team to slow down and test more?"**
- *Note: Gets at culture and leadership.*

**17. "Walk us through your testing pipeline. What's the journey from 'code written' to 'deployed on mainnet'?"**
- *Note: She mentions: local → staging → audit → internal mainnet. Let her elaborate.*

**18. "You do internal mainnet testing before public launch. What kind of bugs have you caught that way that you wouldn't have found in staging?"**
- *Note: Concrete examples = valuable content.*

**19. "What's your security checklist? If a developer watching this is about to deploy their first contract, what should they be thinking about?"**
- *Note: Actionable framework for audience.*

**20. "You mentioned multi-sig and strict authority separation. How do you set up operational security when you're moving fast?"**
- *Note: Practical ops security.*

---

### Part 5: Solana Ecosystem & Developer Life (10 min)
*Goal: Ecosystem insights, advice for new developers*

**21. "You've been in the Solana ecosystem for 3+ years now. What's changed the most? What's still broken?"**
- *Note: Perspective from someone who's seen the evolution.*

**22. "You've worked across smart contracts, RPCs, GRPCs, mobile SDKs. What's the most underrated part of the Solana stack that developers should learn?"**
- *Note: Career advice angle.*

**23. "You've given talks at Solana Hacker Houses and Summit APAC. What's the #1 misconception new Solana developers have?"**
- *Note: Common mistakes to avoid.*

**24. "If someone watching this wants to become a blockchain engineer at a serious project - not just build toy apps - what's the path? What should they build first?"**
- *Note: Career roadmap.*

**25. "You're also big on community - GDSC lead, hackathon mentor, Superteam member. Why does community matter for a developer's career?"**
- *Note: Networking/community angle.*

---

### Part 6: Women in Web3 (5-7 min)
*Goal: Representation, authentic perspective*

**26. "You're a lead engineer at a crypto startup. That's still rare. What's been your experience as a woman in this space?"**
- *Note: Keep it open - let her share authentically.*

**27. "For women watching who are interested in blockchain engineering - what would you tell them? What helped you?"**
- *Note: Actionable advice.*

**28. "Are there communities or people who were particularly important in your journey?"**
- *Note: Shoutouts, recommendations.*
