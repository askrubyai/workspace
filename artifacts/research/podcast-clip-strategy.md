## Clip Structure for 60 Seconds

### The Formula

```
[0-5 sec]  Hook - Grab attention immediately
[5-45 sec] Meat - The actual insight/story
[45-60 sec] Button - Clean ending (ideally quotable)
```

### Hook Types

1. **Question**: "Want to know why most startups fail?"
2. **Bold statement**: "College is a waste of time."
3. **Teaser**: "I made a $10M mistake once..."
4. **Contrast**: "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y"

### Clean Endings

- Full sentence (not mid-thought)
- Quotable one-liner
- Callback to hook
- Clear takeaway

- Mark timestamps of energy changes

### Step 2: Categorize (15 min)

- Note if requires context or stands alone

### Step 3: Extract & Trim (30 min)
- Pull exact quotes with timestamps

### Step 4: Format for Editors (15 min)

## Platform-Specific Notes

### YouTube Shorts
- **Length**: 30-60 sec (59 max)
- **Aspect**: 9:16 vertical
- **Subtitles**: Essential (80% watch muted)
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds CRITICAL
- **End**: Clear conclusion (no cliff-hangers)

### Twitter/X
- **Length**: 60-140 sec works
- **Subtitles**: Yes, large font
- **Native upload**: Always (not YouTube links)
- **Quote tweet**: Works well with context
- **Thread potential**: Can clip lead to longer discussion?

### Instagram Reels
- **Length**: 15-30 sec optimal
- **Energy**: Higher than YouTube
- **Music**: Background helps
- **Trend alignment**: Can it fit a template?

## Quality Checklist

Before marking a clip as ready:

- [ ] Stands alone (no context needed)
- [ ] Clear start (not mid-sentence)
- [ ] Clean end (complete thought)
- [ ] No "um/uh" heavy sections
- [ ] Audio quality is good
- [ ] Has at least one of 3 C's
- [ ] Under 60 seconds (or can be trimmed)
- [ ] Guest looks/sounds good (if video)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too much context**: Clip should work without intro
❌ **Mid-sentence cuts**: Sounds amateur
❌ **Inside jokes**: New viewers won't get it
❌ **Too long**: Attention span is brutal
❌ **No payoff**: Must deliver on the hook
❌ **Bad audio sections**: Skip these entirely
