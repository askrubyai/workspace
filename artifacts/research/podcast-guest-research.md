## Guest Recommendations (Ranked by Fit)

### 🥇 1. Yash Agarwal — SendAI / Solana Agent Kit

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@yashhsm](https://x.com/yashhsm) |
| **Role** | CEO & Co-Founder, SendAI |
| **Location** | India 🇮🇳 |
| **Known for** | Built the **Solana Agent Kit** — THE open-source toolkit connecting AI agents to 30+ Solana protocols. Also runs Send Arcade, ran the first Solana AI Hackathon, writes deep Superteam blog posts (DePIN, Token Extensions). Recently backed by **Solana Labs (Incubator C3)**. |

**Why he's the #1 pick:**
- **Insanely timely:** The Solana x Colosseum **AI Agent Hackathon** (Feb 2–12, 2026) is wrapping up *literally this week*. The Solana Agent Kit is the backbone tool for it. Yash can talk about what agents built, what worked, what broke.
- **Deep technical content:** How the Agent Kit works under the hood — plugin architecture, MCP server integration, how it connects LLMs to on-chain actions, reducing hallucinations with modular tools, embedded wallets (Turnkey/Privy).
- **Solana Labs backing** just announced — fresh alpha.
- He just ran **Solana Consumer Day in Hong Kong** (Feb 10) — literally yesterday. He'll be buzzing with energy.

**Suggested episode angle:** *"How Solana Became the AI Agent Chain — Inside the Agent Kit"*  
Deep dive into: how AI agents actually call Solana programs, the plugin architecture, what the AI hackathon revealed about agent capabilities/limitations, MCP x Solana, where this is all heading.

**Connection path:** Direct Superteam India member. Reuben almost certainly knows him or is 1 DM away. Yash is extremely accessible and active on Twitter. @SuperteamIN can intro if needed.

**Likelihood of saying yes:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **VERY HIGH**  
He's a Superteam India OG, loves doing content, and has fresh stuff to talk about. The only risk is he's been at events and might be traveling. DM him ASAP.

### 🥈 2. Sujith Sizon — Astralane (CTO/Co-Founder)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@sujithsizon](https://x.com/sujithsizon) |
| **Role** | Co-Founder (infra architecture lead), Astralane |
| **Location** | TBD (team is India-connected via Superteam) |
| **Known for** | Building **blazingly fast Solana infrastructure** — microsecond-precision trading, high-speed indexing, low-latency transactions, staking solutions. Astralane is on Colosseum. Recently partnered with Spirit Blockchain Capital on a Staked SOL Index. |

**Why he's a great pick:**
- **Already mentioned to Reuben** — someone brought Astralane up. This validates there's interest.
- **Deeply technical:** Astralane operates at the Solana infra layer — RPC clients, low-latency tx routing, validator-level optimizations. This is exactly the kind of "how does this actually work under the hood" content that OnlyDevs thrives on.
- **Timely:** They're actively shipping (GitHub shows paladin-rpc-client updates in Jan 2026, Rust-based tooling). Co-founder Jaskanwar spoke at Solana Breakpoint about "Solana Economic Zones."
- **Complements the show's DNA:** Similar vibe to the Uri Klarman/Paladin episode (MEV/infra), but from a different angle — more about pure speed and institutional-grade execution.

**Suggested episode angle:** *"Microsecond Trading on Solana — How Astralane Engineers Low-Latency Infra"*  
Deep dive into: what happens between a user clicking "swap" and the tx landing on-chain, how indexing works at scale, what validators actually need, where the speed bottlenecks are, building the "AWS of Solana."

**Connection path:** Superteam network — Jaskanwar is Superteam Canada. Someone already mentioned Astralane to Reuben. DM @sujithsizon or @jaskanwar_singh directly. Could also ask Superteam India leads for intro.

**Likelihood of saying yes:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGH**  
They're growing, not yet huge, and would love the Superteam India podcast platform. A technical deep-dive is exactly their brand. The only question is if they're easy to schedule on short notice.

### 🥉 3. Nitesh Nath — DFlow

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@niteshnath](https://x.com/niteshnath) |
| **Role** | Founder & CEO, DFlow |
| **Location** | USA |
| **Known for** | Built DFlow — a protocol that protects DEX liquidity against toxic order flow. Recently launched the **DFlow Prediction Markets API** — first tokenization layer bringing **Kalshi's prediction markets** to Solana (Dec 2025). Former quant researcher at **DRW**. |

**Why he's a great pick:**
- **Hot topic:** Prediction markets + tokenization is one of the biggest narratives right now. DFlow just shipped the Kalshi integration on Solana — featured on solana.com homepage.
- **Deeply technical + TradFi brain:** Ex-DRW quant → built internet-native market structure. Can go deep on order flow, toxic MEV, payment for order flow, market microstructure.
- **Already validated as a podcast guest:** Done Solana's Validated podcast, TOKEN2049 keynote, Talking Tokens — knows how to articulate complex ideas.
- **Spoke at TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025** on "Internet-Native Market Structure."

**Suggested episode angle:** *"Tokenizing Prediction Markets — How DFlow Brings Kalshi to Solana"*  
Deep dive into: what "tokenization layer" actually means, how the Prediction Markets API works, DEX liquidity defense, order flow classification, why prediction markets need their own infra, composability implications.

**Connection path:** Less direct — not in the India Superteam orbit specifically. Reach through Solana ecosystem connections, or cold DM on Twitter. He's active and responsive. Helius team might know him (they wrote about DFlow using LaserStream).

**Likelihood of saying yes:** ⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM**  
He does podcasts but tends to do bigger platforms. OnlyDevs is growing though — with the Superteam India brand and past guests like Siong/Uri, it's credible enough. Cold DM with a specific angle would work.

### 4. Swen Schäferjohann — Light Protocol

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@swen_sjn](https://x.com/swen_sjn) |
| **Role** | Co-Founder & CEO, Light Protocol |
| **Location** | Europe |
| **Known for** | Created **ZK Compression** for Solana — 100–1000x cheaper account creation. Light Protocol just shipped light-token, is featured in Colosseum's latest Codex, and has mainnet integration with Helius. |

**Why he's a great pick:**
- **ZK Compression is a massive infrastructure upgrade** — it fundamentally changes the economics of building on Solana. If you're building anything that creates accounts (tokens, NFTs, social, gaming), this matters.
- **Deep technical territory** perfect for the show: zero-knowledge proofs, merkle trees, how compressed accounts work, BPF verification of ZK proofs on-chain.
- **Timely:** Light-token recently shipped. ZK Compression is being adopted by more projects.
- **Not over-exposed** — done a few podcasts but not the circuit regular. Fresh perspective for the audience.

**Suggested episode angle:** *"ZK Compression: How Light Protocol Makes Solana 1000x Cheaper"*  
Deep dive into: what ZK compression actually does (account model, merkle trees, proof verification), why it matters for scaling, how builders integrate it, the road from devnet to mainnet, what's next.

**Connection path:** Through Solana/Superteam ecosystem. Helius folks could intro (they collaborated on indexer support). Or cold DM — Swen is responsive on Twitter.

**Likelihood of saying yes:** ⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM**  
Europe timezone might make scheduling tricky for this week. But he'd likely be interested — OnlyDevs is the right audience for this content.

### 5. Credible Finance (Founder TBD)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@crediblefin](https://x.com/crediblefin) |
| **Role** | India-based, Colosseum Accelerator Cohort 4 |
| **Known for** | Building a **stablecoin-powered payment orchestration layer** for cross-border remittances — targeting banks, fintechs, and PSPs sending money in/out of India. Uses embedded PayFi credit to eliminate pre-funding. Won at Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon (Dec 2025). |

**Why they're a great pick:**
- **India-focused, India-based** — perfect for the Superteam India audience.
- **Incredibly relevant topic:** Stablecoins for India remittances is a massive TAM ($100B+ annually). Regulatory angle with India's crypto stance makes this juicy.
- **Fresh from Colosseum Cohort 4** — literally just accepted (Dec 2025), currently in accelerator. Will have fresh energy and new developments.
- **Technical depth available:** Payment orchestration, T+0 settlement, stablecoin credit rails, integration with existing banking infrastructure.

**Suggested episode angle:** *"Building Stablecoin Rails for India's $100B Remittance Market on Solana"*  
Deep dive into: how the payment orchestration layer works, T+0 settlement mechanics, stablecoin credit (Send Now Pay Later), why Solana for payments, navigating India's regulatory environment.

**Connection path:** Colosseum network, Superteam India (they're an India project). Very likely within Reuben's extended network. DM @crediblefin directly.

**Likelihood of saying yes:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **VERY HIGH**  
They're early-stage, in an accelerator, and would love the exposure. Being featured on a Superteam India podcast is exactly what they need right now. Almost certainly available and eager.

### 6. Unruggable (@unruggable_io)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@unruggable_io](https://x.com/unruggable_io) |
| **Role** | Grand Champion, Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon (Dec 2025); Colosseum Cohort 4 |
| **Location** | United Kingdom 🇬🇧 |
| **Known for** | Building a **next-generation hardware wallet + companion app** purpose-built for Solana. Won the biggest Solana hackathon of 2025. @solana official account tweeted their win. |

**Why they're a great pick:**
- **Reigning hackathon champion** — "How we won the Cypherpunk Hackathon" is inherently compelling.
- **Hardware wallet security** is deeply technical: secure element design, signing flows, key derivation, Solana-specific optimizations vs. Ledger's generic approach.
- **Solana officially celebrated their win** — signals legitimacy and interest.
- **Underdog story** that fits the "discovery" format of the show.

**Suggested episode angle:** *"Building the Solana-Native Hardware Wallet — From Hackathon Grand Prize to Product"*  
Deep dive into: why existing hardware wallets fail Solana users, secure element architecture, signing flow design, companion app integration, what it takes to win a 9,000-person hackathon.

**Connection path:** Colosseum network. Could also ask @SuperteamIN for intro. DM @unruggable_io directly.

**Likelihood of saying yes:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGH**  
They're in growth mode and would love visibility. UK timezone might require some scheduling gymnastics, but a daytime India / morning UK slot could work.

### 7. Cloak (@cloak_xyz) — Privacy Layer for Solana

| | |
|---|---|
| **Twitter** | [@cloak_xyz](https://x.com/cloak_xyz) |
| **Role** | Colosseum Accelerator Cohort 4 |
| **Location** | Brazil |
| **Known for** | Building a **privacy layer for crypto** using ZK proofs that run at Solana speed. Cypherpunk Hackathon winner. |

**Why they'd be great:**
- **Privacy on Solana** is a huge unsolved problem — every transaction is public. This is the cypherpunk ethos.
- Deeply technical: ZK proof systems, privacy-preserving transactions, how to achieve privacy without sacrificing speed.
- Topical: regulatory debates about privacy coins/mixers make this timely.
- Fresh from winning at the Cypherpunk Hackathon.

**Suggested episode angle:** *"ZK Privacy at Solana Speed — How Cloak Solves Blockchain's Biggest Privacy Problem"*

**Connection path:** Colosseum/Superteam network. DM @cloak_xyz.

## Recommended Outreach Strategy

**Plan A:** DM Yash (@yashhsm) immediately. He's the perfect fit on every dimension. Frame it as: "We want to deep-dive into the Solana Agent Kit with the AI hackathon wrapping up this week. Technical audience. ~45-60 min. Can we shoot this week?"

**Plan B:** DM Sujith (@sujithsizon) or Jas (@jaskanwar_singh) at Astralane. Someone already mentioned them, so there's warm context.

**Plan C:** DM Credible Finance (@crediblefin) — they're India-based, in Colosseum, and would jump at the chance.

**Timeline:** Given the "this week" constraint, DM today (Feb 11) and aim to shoot by Feb 14-15. Yash or Credible are most likely to be responsive and available.
