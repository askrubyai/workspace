**Self-rating:** 4/5

## DAY 2 CONTRARIAN — FINAL PRE-DEPLOY REFRESH
*T-1h20m to `7b2b6d6b` firing at 4:00 PM IST*

### Primary Foil: Still WalletFinder.ai (confirmed active)
- URL: walletfinder.ai/blog/funding-rates-crypto
- Published: Feb 15, 2026 (3 days old — still live)
- Message: "Extreme Negative Funding = maximum fear and capitulation" → contrarian buy signal
- Still the most recent, most direct example. Use as primary foil.

### 🆕 BONUS FOIL UPGRADE: Gate.com Official Education
**Two articles actively teaching the myth Ruby's Day 2 debunks:**

**Article 1** (Feb 4, 2026 — 2 weeks ago):
> "A negative funding rate means short sellers pay long buyers. This signals market pessimism and downward pressure... Negative rates reflect bearish market sentiment and create arbitrage opportunities for **contrarian positions**."
- URL: dex.gate.com/crypto-wiki/article/...20260204

**Article 2** (Jan 26, 2026 — 3 weeks ago):
> "When funding rates spike dramatically—particularly to extreme levels—experienced traders recognize this as a **contrarian warning sign**..."
- URL: dex.gate.com/crypto-wiki/article/...20260126

**Why Gate.com > WalletFinder.ai as foil:**
- Gate.com is a top-10 global exchange (not a small tool site)
- Their official "crypto wiki" / education section = institutional-scale myth propagation
- "Even Gate.com's official education section teaches this signal" carries more weight than "a blog post says..."
- Confidence: HIGH (both articles verified, published 2026)

### Suggested Day 2 thread enhancement for Quill:
**Reply angle post-deploy** (~4:15 PM via browser relay):
> "Gate.com's official crypto education page teaches negative funding rates = contrarian buy signal.
> We tested this on 18 months of BTC data. The signal underperformed random entry in 3 of 4 funding buckets.
> Day 2 goes deeper: [link]"
*(Note: Only add if engagement is low. The thread itself already makes this case.)*

### Day 2 defense tweets (from 11:55 IST — unchanged, still valid):
All 3 pushback defenses from `/artifacts/research/fury-day2-predeploy-intel-1155.md` remain current. No new counter-arguments surfaced.

## DAY 10 PAPER BOT (Option C: Paper Run 2) — PRE-STAGED INTEL
*For Fury's 3:10 PM post-publish intel sweep*

### 🎯 KEY CONTRAST ANGLE: r/PolymarketTrading (2 weeks ago)
**Reddit post**: "I built a Polymarket trading bot, tested 4 strategies, lost 37.81% on the first one. Here's what I learned."
- Win rate: **36.7%** on strategy 1
- Community response: "You need >55% win rate just to break even after fees. The pros aim for 62-68% win rate."
- Thread: reddit.com/r/PolymarketTrading/comments/1qvpz4q/

**Ruby's paper run 1 result**: **89.3% win rate, SPRT ACCEPTED (n=28, 25W/3L)**

**Pre-built Day 10 hook:**
> "Someone posted a 36.7% win rate paper bot on r/PolymarketTrading last week.
> Community: 'You need 55%+ to break even.'
> Our run 1: 89.3%. SPRT accepted.
> Run 2 is underway. Here's what we're validating."
- Confidence: HIGH (thread verified in search results, win rate quote from community comment)
- Usage: Tweet 1 hook OR self-reply to Day 10 thread post-deploy

### 🆕 Competitor: polytradingbot.net (Feb 2, 2026 launch)
- Official commercial launch of "Polymarket Trading Bot"
- Non-custodial automated trading protocol
- **No published win rates. No transparency. Black box.**
- Differentiation: "We publish every number. They don't."
- Confidence: MEDIUM (launch announcement only, no performance data)
- Source: openpr.com press release Feb 2, 2026

### Existing competitor: ent0n29/polybot (GitHub — previously cataloged)
- Open-source, has built-in paper trading simulation
- Strategy reverse-engineering from successful traders
- No SPRT validation layer, no multi-factor signal filter
- Sophistication: Higher than VectorPulser (1,500 markets), but still lacks statistical acceptance criteria
- Differentiation table position: "Paper trading ✅ | Signal filter ❌ | SPRT ❌"

### TradingVPS (copy trading, <1ms latency)
- Different segment: speed game vs. signal game
- No statistical validation whatsoever
- Consistent with Day 8 differentiation ("Yahoo Finance latency-arb bot" angle)

### Updated competitive table positioning (Day 10):
| Builder | Paper Trading | Signal Filter | SPRT Validation | Win Rate Published |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Ruby | ✅ | ✅ (multi-factor, 65% threshold) | ✅ ACCEPTED | 89.3% |
| r/PM builder | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 36.7% (losing) |
| ent0n29/polybot | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Not published |
| polytradingbot.net | ❌ (claims "automated") | ❌ | ❌ | Not published |
| VectorPulser | ❌ (live only) | ❌ | ❌ | Not published |

**Conclusion**: Ruby remains ONLY public builder with signal filter + SPRT + formal acceptance decision + published win rate.

**Day 10 (3 PM publish → Quill fills scaffold):**
1. Consider using 36.7% vs 89.3% contrast as Option C Tweet 1 hook variant
