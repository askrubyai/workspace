## 3. 🎵 Wooden Flute (Bansuri)

### Which Key for Beginners?

**Recommended: Start with C Natural Medium (19 inches)**

Here's the breakdown:

|-----|------|----------|

### Maintenance Tips 🔧
1. **After playing**: Swab out moisture with a soft cloth on a thin rod — never leave wet
2. **Oil regularly**: Use coconut oil, almond oil, or mustard oil every 2-4 weeks
   - Apply with a soft cloth through the bore, up to the blow hole only
   - Oil the finger holes and blow hole edges with a Q-tip
   - **Never oil a wet/freshly played bansuri** — let it dry first
3. **Storage**: Keep in carry bag, away from direct sunlight and extreme heat/cold
4. **Avoid AC vents**: Dry air can crack bamboo
5. **Check threading**: The string binding can loosen over time — get it re-wound if needed
6. **Break-in period**: Play for short sessions initially (15-20 min), gradually increase
7. **Mumbai humidity**: Actually good for bamboo! But avoid leaving near windows during monsoon

## 4. 👟 Running Shoes (Flat Feet, Wide Toe Box)

### Stability vs Neutral: The Debate

**For flat feet, stability shoes are generally recommended**, but it depends on your type:

- **Flexible flat feet** (arch visible when not weight-bearing) → **Stability shoes recommended**, but stable neutrals can work for mild overpronation
- **Rigid flat feet** (arch never visible) → **Stability shoes strongly recommended**

**Key stability features to look for:**
- Medial post (prevents inward rolling)
- Dual-density midsole
- Wide, stiff platform
- Stiff heel counter
- Sole flares

**Quick test**: Stand on tiptoes — if arches appear, you have flexible flat feet.

### Top 5 Recommendations

| **Availability** | ⚠️ Limited in India — not on Flipkart/Amazon officially. Check hypefly.co.in or import |

**Why**: RunRepeat's #1 for flat feet AND wide toe box. Incredibly stable. But the low drop (2.2mm) may not suit heel strikers. Limited India availability is the main downside.

| **Wide sizes** | Available in Wide (2E) internationally |

**Why**: The GTS (Go-To-Shoe) is one of the most recommended stability shoes globally. GuideRails provide holistic support. Very comfortable. But India availability can be spotty.
