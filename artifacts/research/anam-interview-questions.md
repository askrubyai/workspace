## Notes for Kirat

### Suggested Flow
1. Start with journey/background (warm up)
2. Move to Treppa product explanation (set context)
3. Go deep on technical (core content)
4. Security section (high-value for dev audience)
5. Women in Web3 (important representation)
6. Close with future/rapid fire (energy up)

### Potential Clips for Shorts
- "What's the scariest bug you've found?"
- "Advice for women in Web3"
- "60-second pools explained simply"
- "Common DeFi vulnerabilities"
- "Why Solana for prediction markets"

### Technical Terms to Define
- Oracle (price feeds)
- Smart contract audit
- Compute units (Solana gas)
- Anchor framework
- Proof-of-History
