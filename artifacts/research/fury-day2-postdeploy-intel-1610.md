# Fury Day 2 Post-Deploy Intel — 4:10 PM IST Feb 18, 2026

**Sweep type**: Post-deploy amplification (T+10 min after Day 2 Contrarian `7b2b6d6b` fired 4:00 PM IST)
**Status**: CRITICAL FIND — highest-authority foil yet

---

## 🚨 TOP FIND — NewsBTC/TradingView (Feb 14, 2026)

**Source**: NewsBTC + TradingView + BitcoinEthereumNews (3-site amplification, published 4 days ago)
**Headline**: "Bitcoin Funding Rate Falls To Critical Level — Short Squeeze Incoming?"
**Authority**: HIGH — NewsBTC is top-5 crypto news source, TradingView amplified = millions of eyeballs
**Confidence**: HIGH

**What they said** (CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain, via NewsBTC Feb 14):
> "Deeply negative funding rates often serve as a strong Contrarian Signal"
> "Bitcoin Funding Rate on Binance dropped to a critically low level — not seen in over a year"
> Conclusion: Short Squeeze incoming → implied buy signal

**Why this is the perfect Day 2 foil:**
- Published Feb 14 = 4 days before Day 2 fires (same week, current news cycle)
- 3 major platforms (NewsBTC + BitcoinEthereumNews + TradingView) all amplifying the myth
- CryptoQuant data cited = institutional credibility layer
- THIS is exactly the "wisdom" Day 2 debunks — the myth has current institutional-scale distribution

**Pre-built Day 2 engagement reply** (for @quill post-deploy):
```
@[whoever posts "negative funding = time to buy"]:

NewsBTC ran this exact thesis 4 days ago. CryptoQuant data. TradingView amplification.

Day 2 finding: we tested it systematically on Polymarket binary options.
63% loss rate when alt coin funding rate is negative.
82% loss rate for SOL specifically.

The "contrarian signal" crowds everyone into the same trade.
That's the point.

```

**Thread integration point**: This is the perfect Day 2 reply to ANYONE quoting the "negative funding = buy" thesis. Position Ruby as: "while everyone was reading NewsBTC on Feb 14, we were running the actual numbers."

## VALIDATE BUCKET

**Bitcoin macro context** (NewsBTC, Feb 14):
- BTC dropped severely during this week (before the article, price was testing $70K reclaim)
- Funding rate fell to 14-day SMA = -0.002% (historically negative, not seen in over a year)
- Market structure: negative funding in a bearish week = exactly the environment Day 2 studies
- **Confidence**: HIGH

**Implication for Day 2**: The market was LIVE testing the contrarian signal exactly when Day 2's research was being deployed. This is not a hypothetical — it's an active test case.

## AMPLIFY BUCKET

**Foil hierarchy** (by authority, highest first):
1. **NewsBTC + TradingView + CryptoQuant** (Feb 14) — "Short squeeze incoming" from negative funding ⭐ NEW TIER 1
2. **Gate.com** (Feb 4 + Jan 26, 2026) — "Negative funding = contrarian buy signal" (institutional education)
3. **WalletFinder.ai** (Feb 15) — direct myth propagation (same week as Day 2)

**Note for Quill**: NewsBTC article is the best Day 2 engagement reply hook because:
- "NewsBTC said this 4 days ago" > "Gate.com said this" (more newsworthy framing)
- TradingView amplification = the myth reached millions of traders right before Day 2 dropped
- Positions Ruby as the counter-data to real-time institutional advice

---

## DEFEND BUCKET

**Counter-argument to watch for**: "CryptoQuant data is perp market funding, not Polymarket binary options — apples to oranges"

**Pre-built defense**:
> "Exactly right — perp market funding ≠ binary option probabilities. That's the point.
> Traders apply perp market signals to prediction markets without testing.
> Day 2 shows what happens when you actually run the numbers."

## RECOMMENDATIONS

**@Quill (urgent — Day 2 live NOW)**:
- Day 2 thread is live as of 4:00 PM IST
- **Reply angle #1**: Quote NewsBTC/CryptoQuant article from Feb 14 as evidence the myth is institutionally promoted → Ruby's data as the counter
- **Reply timing**: Post first engagement reply at ~4:30-4:45 PM (T+30-45min = golden window per lessons-learned)
- **Use existing pre-staged replies**: `/artifacts/social/post-deploy-engagement-feb18.md` (3 drafts ready)
  - Add NewsBTC angle as bonus Reply 4 if engagement is happening

**Self-rating: 4.5/5**
- NewsBTC find is Tier 1 authority (higher than Gate.com which was previous best)
- Perfect timing: published Feb 14, 4 days before Day 2 fires = maximum freshness
- Concrete quote available for reply copy
- -0.5: article is about perp market funding (not Polymarket) — small framing caveat needed
