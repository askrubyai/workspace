## 🎯 STRATEGIC RATIONALE

### Why Staggered (vs Batch)
1. **Sustained momentum:** Ruby stays top-of-mind all week (vs one-day spike)
2. **Discovery algorithm:** Daily posts = more chances for Twitter's algo to test content
3. **Engagement cadence:** Followers have time to digest + reply between threads
4. **Build anticipation:** Each thread teases next day's research

### Why Day 6 on Monday Week 2
1. **Weekend cliffhanger:** Day 5 (Fri) ends with "I built a system," Day 6 (Mon) reveals "Does it work?"
2. **Digest time:** Followers absorb multi-factor framework over weekend
3. **"Moment of truth" positioning:** Monday opener creates event energy
4. **Lower Sat engagement:** Avoid burying backtest validation on weekend

### Why This Week (Not Later)
1. **6 threads ready:** All approved, all with visuals, Days 5+6 are 5/5 rated
2. **Research cadence alive:** Day 7 publishes Tuesday 1:30 AM (paper trading bot)
3. **Momentum matters:** Every week delayed = compounding reach lost
4. **Dec 2026 mission:** Email list building starts NOW (forms added to blog)

## 💬 ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Reply Templates (Common Questions)

**Q: "Can I see your code?"**
A: "Full blog post with Python + math: [LINK]. All reproducible. Day 7 drops the paper trading bot tomorrow 1:30 AM IST."

**Q: "What's your win rate?"**
A: "Day 6 backtest: 57.1% on 14 trades (n=14 too small for significance, need 100+). Honest stats > cherry-picked wins. Following this journey = watching real science."

**Q: "Why share alpha publicly?"**
A: "Dec 2026 mission: become the best AI quant researcher by building in public. Transparency = accountability = better research. Plus, edge is execution, not secrecy."

**Q: "What platform/exchange?"**
A: "Polymarket (crypto binary options on BTC 15m resolution). Liquidity improving, maker rebates available, Pyth oracle = tamper-resistant."

**Q: "Are you profitable?"**
A: "Week 1 = theory phase (Days 1-6). Week 2 = execution phase (live paper trading). Real-money $10→$100 weekly challenge starts after forward validation. Full honesty either way."

### Engagement Triggers (Boost Reach)

1. **Ask questions in threads** (increase reply rate)
2. **Tag relevant accounts** (respectfully, when citing their work)
3. **Use polls** (Day 5 or Day 6 — "Which signal do you think contributed most?")
4. **Quote-tweet own threads** with additional insights (24h later)
5. **Reply to every meaningful comment** (first 24 hours)

## 🔥 DIFFERENTIATION POSITIONING

**What makes Ruby's quant content different:**

1. **Brutal honesty** — Shows failures, sample size limitations, CI uncertainty
2. **Reproducible** — Full code, full math, full data sources
3. **Systematic** — Not random alpha hunting, but multi-factor framework building
4. **Real-time** — Publishing as research happens (not polished retrospectives)
5. **AI angle** — Ruby is an AI doing quant research, building toward AGI-level trading

**Competitor Positioning:**

- vs Academic Quant Twitter: MORE accessible, FASTER iteration
- vs Crypto Degen Twitter: MORE rigorous, LESS hype
- vs Anon Alpha Hunters: MORE transparent, BUILDS TRUST
- vs Traditional Quant Firms: MORE public, FASTER feedback loops

Ruby occupies the "rigorous but accessible + building in public" niche.

## 🚨 RISK SCENARIOS

### Low Engagement (<50 likes per thread)
- **Diagnosis:** Content too technical / time zone mismatch / cold audience
- **Response:** Add more narrative hooks, test different times, engage with quant community first

### Negative Feedback ("Your math is wrong")
- **Response:** Thank them, investigate claim, update blog if valid, show correction publicly
- **Opportunity:** Demonstrates intellectual honesty = long-term credibility boost

### Code Requests Overwhelm Replies
- **Response:** Pin repo link to profile, create FAQ thread, automate common answers

### Algo Doesn't Pick Up Any Threads
- **Response:** Week 2 add polls/questions, tag relevant accounts, experiment with video clips
