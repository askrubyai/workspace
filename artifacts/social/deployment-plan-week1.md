**Theory Arc Complete:** Days 1-6 form complete multi-factor framework + empirical validation. Week 2 = live execution.

---

## Recommended Deployment Schedule

### **Option A: 6-Day Arc with Monday "Moment of Truth" (RECOMMENDED)**
Build theory Mon-Fri, validate Monday Week 2.

| Day | Thread | Post Time | Rationale |
|-----|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Monday, Feb 17** | Day 1 (Funding Rates) | 9:00 AM IST | Foundation: establishes research rigor |
| **Tuesday, Feb 18** | Day 2 (Contrarian Signals) | 4:00 PM IST | Myth-busting drives engagement |
| **Wednesday, Feb 19** | Day 3 (Liquidity Clusters) | 9:00 AM IST | Human-vs-bot narrative hook |
| **Thursday, Feb 20** | Day 4 (Implied Vol) | 4:00 PM IST | Edge-but-fees problem + escape routes |
| **Friday, Feb 21** | Day 5 (Regime Detector) | 9:00 AM IST | **SYNTHESIS** — all 5 signals click together (5/5 rating) |
| **Monday, Feb 24** | Day 6 (Backtest Results) | 9:00 AM IST | **VALIDATION** — empirical test with real BTC data (5/5 rating) |

**Why this works:**
- Mon-Fri: Build complete multi-factor framework (Days 1-5)
- Weekend: Followers digest synthesis, anticipate validation
- Monday Week 2: "Moment of truth" thread (does the framework work?)
- **Narrative tension:** Day 5 reveals the system, Day 6 proves/disproves it
- **Bridge to execution:** Day 6 conclusion = "theory complete, paper trading next"
- **Two consecutive 5/5 threads** separated by weekend = maximum impact

---

### **Option B: Staggered 6-Day (Mon-Sat)**
All 6 threads in one week, Day 6 as Saturday closer.

| Day | Thread | Post Time |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Mon Feb 17 | Day 1 | 9:00 AM IST |
| Tue Feb 18 | Day 2 | 4:00 PM IST |
| Wed Feb 19 | Day 3 | 9:00 AM IST |
| Thu Feb 20 | Day 4 | 4:00 PM IST |
| Fri Feb 21 | Day 5 | 9:00 AM IST |
| Sat Feb 22 | Day 6 | 9:00 AM IST |

**Pros:** Complete theory arc in one week, maintains daily cadence  
**Cons:** Saturday engagement typically lower, loses weekend cliffhanger tension

---

### **Option C: Batch Drop (All 6 Monday)**
Post all 6 threads Monday morning (9 AM IST), pin Day 6, let followers binge-read.

**Pros:** Maximum initial visibility, shows work volume, immediate social proof  
**Cons:** Dilutes engagement per thread, no daily momentum, synthesis/validation narrative loses buildup

---

## Copy-Paste Ready Tweets

### **Day 1: Funding Rate Arbitrage**

**Thread Start:**
```
BTC funding rate arbitrage is dead.

3.99% APY with locked capital and execution risk?

That's not alpha. That's a savings account.

But the long tail is where it gets interesting:

🧵👇
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `btc-funding-timeseries.png`
- Tweet 4: `altcoin-funding-bars.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day1-funding-rate-thread.md`

---

### **Day 2: Contrarian Signals**

**Thread Start:**
```
Crypto Twitter's favorite contrarian signal is backwards.

"Buy when funding is deeply negative" — repeated endlessly by influencers.

I pulled 197 BTC observations + 3 altcoins.

The data destroys this narrative:

🧵👇
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `day2-funding-winrate-bars.png`
- Tweet 4: `day2-altcoin-comparison.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day2-contrarian-signal-thread.md`

---

### **Day 3: Liquidity Clusters**

**Thread Start:**
```
A human trader just beat my bot.

$20 → $50 in one session. 150% return. 10 trades on Polymarket's 5-minute BTC markets.

I reverse-engineered the strategy. Here's the math behind why it works

🧵👇
```

- Tweet 5: `day3-concordance-matrix.png`
- Tweet 8: `day3-confidence-interval.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day3-liquidity-cluster-thread.md`

---

### **Day 4: Implied Volatility**

**Thread Start:**
```
Every Polymarket binary option price is secretly screaming a number at you.

It's not just "63% chance BTC goes up" — it's "the market thinks BTC volatility is 47.2% annualized."

Day 4: I learned to hear what the market is whispering. And then I learned why it doesn't matter (yet).

🧵👇
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `day4-iv-extraction-flow.png`
- Tweet 7: `day4-escape-routes.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day4-implied-volatility-thread.md`

---

### **Day 5: Regime Detector (SYNTHESIS THREAD — 5/5 rating)**

**Thread Start:**
```
🎯 Day 5: Built a regime detector that knows WHEN the edge is actually there

The problem with volatility selling: the premium averages 0.037% per trade — 80× smaller than the 3% fee

But after vol spikes? It expands 3.6×

The detector catches these windows automatically 🧵
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `regime-state-machine.png` (CALM → SPIKE → POST-SPIKE decay cycle)
- Tweet 5: `vrp-expansion-chart.png` (3.6× VRP expansion bar chart)
- Tweet 8: `multi-factor-framework.png` (Days 1-5 synthesis flowchart)

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day5-regime-detector-thread.md`

**Why this thread is special:**
- ✅ **First 5/5 editorial rating** (Loki) — deployment-ready with zero changes
- ✅ **Synthesis payoff:** Shows how all 5 days connect into unified multi-factor system
- ✅ **Strategic positioning:** Makes Days 1-4 retroactively more valuable (aha! moment for followers)
- ✅ **Honest validation:** Acknowledges synthetic data limitations, builds Day 6 anticipation

**Deployment note:** Recommended as SYNTHESIS thread (Friday) — reveals multi-factor framework.

---

### **Day 6: Multi-Factor Backtest Results (SECOND 5/5 rating)**

**Thread Start:**
```
The noise is louder than the signal.

I backtested my 6-day multi-factor pipeline on 30 days of real BTC data (Jan 15 – Feb 14, 2026).

14 trades. 57.1% win rate. +0.12% edge per trade with maker orders.

But here's the brutal truth about what I actually learned:

🧵👇
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `day6-winrate-edge-comparison.png` (57% win rate, opposite edge with taker fees)
- Tweet 4: `day6-edge-decomposition.png` (regime +0.06%, clusters +0.04%, VRP +0.02%)
- Tweet 7: `day6-multi-factor-scorecard.png` (Days 1-6 synthesis table with emoji ratings)

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day6-backtest-thread.md`

**Why this thread is special:**
- ✅ **Second consecutive 5/5 editorial rating** (Loki) — deployment-ready with zero changes
- ✅ **Empirical validation:** 30 days real BTC data (Jan-Feb 2026 $91K→$68K drawdown period)
- ✅ **Brutal honesty signature:** "Noise term exceeds signal" — unflinching self-assessment builds trust
- ✅ **Educational depth:** Teaches backtest methodology, not just results (reproducible framework)
- ✅ **Multi-factor scorecard:** Ties all 6 days together (cluster proximity MVP at 4/5, regime timing 4/5)
- ✅ **Forward momentum:** "Theory complete, paper trading next" — bridges to Week 2 execution

**Deployment note:** Recommended as VALIDATION thread (Monday Week 2) — proves/disproves the framework with real data.

## Appendix: Why This Matters

**Ruby's Mission:** Become best quant trader by Dec 2026  
**Weekly Challenge:** $10 → $100 (starts Week 2)  
**Blog:** Public accountability + knowledge sharing  
**Twitter:** Audience building + feedback loop

**Theory Arc (Days 1-6) establishes:**
- ✅ **Technical credibility:** Rigorous methodology (IV extraction, regime detection, multi-factor backtesting)
- ✅ **Honest self-assessment:** Statistical humility (CI limitations, n=14 insufficient, "noise > signal")
- ✅ **Build-in-public transparency:** Showing full process (wins, losses, pivot decisions)
- ✅ **Educational depth:** Teaching backtest methodology, not just claiming alpha
- ✅ **Differentiation:** "Most quant content cherry-picks wins. I'm doing the opposite."

**Narrative Arc:**
- Days 1-4: Build foundation (funding, contrarian, clusters, volatility)
- Day 5: Synthesis (reveal multi-factor framework — first 5/5 rating)
- Day 6: Validation (empirical backtest with real data — second 5/5 rating)
- Week 2: Execution (live paper trading, 100+ trades for significance)

**Long-term compounding:**
- Theory Arc: 75-150 followers (foundation)
- Week 4: 300-500 followers (momentum)
- Week 12: 1,500+ followers (critical mass)
- Week 26: 7,500+ followers (distribution platform)
- Week 52: Ruby's research is a known brand in crypto quant Twitter

**Strategic Positioning:**
Two consecutive 5/5 editorial ratings (Days 5+6) = quality signal to followers. Brutal honesty about marginal edge (0.12%) + small sample (n=14) = trust compound. Transparent methodology = educational value. This is the foundation for Dec 2026 mission.

---

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Deployment plan ready (6 threads)  
**Blocking:** Reuben's approval to proceed  
**Time to deploy:** 2-3 hours (account setup + posting over 6 days)  
**Expected ROI:** Audience foundation + credibility for Dec 2026 mission
