## Recommended Deployment Schedule

### **Option A: Staggered Release (RECOMMENDED)**
Spreads engagement over 5 days, builds anticipation, culminates with synthesis thread.

| Day | Thread | Post Time | Rationale |
|-----|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Monday, Feb 16** | Day 1 (Funding Rates) | 9:00 AM IST | Crypto trader morning, establishes foundation |
| **Tuesday, Feb 17** | Day 2 (Contrarian Signals) | 4:00 PM IST | US morning, myth-busting = engagement |
| **Wednesday, Feb 18** | Day 3 (Liquidity Clusters) | 9:00 AM IST | Technical depth, human-vs-bot hook |
| **Thursday, Feb 19** | Day 4 (Implied Vol) | 4:00 PM IST | Edge-but-fees problem, 3 escape routes |
| **Friday, Feb 20** | Day 5 (Regime Detector) | 9:00 AM IST | **SYNTHESIS PAYOFF** — shows how all 5 days connect (5/5 rating) |

**Why this works:**
- Consistent cadence (1 thread/day)
- Alternating times catch different time zones
- Builds narrative momentum across the week
- Each thread teases the next (forward momentum)
- **Day 5 as finale:** First 5/5 editorial rating, reveals multi-factor framework that makes Days 1-4 retroactively more valuable

---

### **Option B: Batch Drop**
Post all 5 threads Monday morning (9 AM IST), pin Day 5, let followers binge-read.

**Pros:** Maximum initial visibility, shows work volume  
**Cons:** Dilutes engagement per thread, no daily momentum, Day 5 synthesis loses narrative buildup

---

### **Option C: Front-Loaded (3+2)**
Monday: Day 1+2+3 (9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM)  
Thursday: Day 4+5 (9 AM, 4 PM)

**Pros:** Quick foundation, synthesis closer together  
**Cons:** Concentration risk, Day 5 payoff arrives too soon (readers haven't absorbed Days 1-4 yet)

## Copy-Paste Ready Tweets

### **Day 1: Funding Rate Arbitrage**

**Thread Start:**
```
BTC funding rate arbitrage is dead.

3.99% APY with locked capital and execution risk?

That's not alpha. That's a savings account.

But the long tail is where it gets interesting:

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `btc-funding-timeseries.png`
- Tweet 4: `altcoin-funding-bars.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day1-funding-rate-thread.md`

---

### **Day 2: Contrarian Signals**

**Thread Start:**
```
Crypto Twitter's favorite contrarian signal is backwards.

"Buy when funding is deeply negative" — repeated endlessly by influencers.

I pulled 197 BTC observations + 3 altcoins.

The data destroys this narrative:

- Tweet 4: `day2-altcoin-comparison.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day2-contrarian-signal-thread.md`

---

### **Day 3: Liquidity Clusters**

**Thread Start:**
```
A human trader just beat my bot.

$20 → $50 in one session. 150% return. 10 trades on Polymarket's 5-minute BTC markets.

I reverse-engineered the strategy. Here's the math behind why it works

🧵👇
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `day3-liquidity-heatmap.png`
- Tweet 5: `day3-concordance-matrix.png`
- Tweet 8: `day3-confidence-interval.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day3-liquidity-cluster-thread.md`

---

### **Day 4: Implied Volatility**

**Thread Start:**
```
Every Polymarket binary option price is secretly screaming a number at you.

It's not just "63% chance BTC goes up" — it's "the market thinks BTC volatility is 47.2% annualized."

Day 4: I learned to hear what the market is whispering. And then I learned why it doesn't matter (yet).

🧵👇
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `day4-iv-extraction-flow.png`
- Tweet 7: `day4-escape-routes.png`

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day4-implied-volatility-thread.md`

---

### **Day 5: Regime Detector (SYNTHESIS THREAD — 5/5 rating)**

**Thread Start:**
```
🎯 Day 5: Built a regime detector that knows WHEN the edge is actually there

The problem with volatility selling: the premium averages 0.037% per trade — 80× smaller than the 3% fee

But after vol spikes? It expands 3.6×

The detector catches these windows automatically 🧵
```

**Visual Assets:**
- Tweet 3: `regime-state-machine.png` (CALM → SPIKE → POST-SPIKE decay cycle)
- Tweet 5: `vrp-expansion-chart.png` (3.6× VRP expansion bar chart)
- Tweet 8: `multi-factor-framework.png` (Days 1-5 synthesis flowchart)

**Full thread:** `/artifacts/social/day5-regime-detector-thread.md`

**Why this thread is special:**
- ✅ **First 5/5 editorial rating** (Loki) — deployment-ready with zero changes
- ✅ **Synthesis payoff:** Shows how all 5 days connect into unified multi-factor system
- ✅ **Strategic positioning:** Makes Days 1-4 retroactively more valuable (aha! moment for followers)
- ✅ **Honest validation:** Acknowledges synthetic data limitations, builds Day 6 anticipation

**Deployment note:** Recommended as FINAL thread (Friday) for maximum narrative payoff.

## Risk Mitigation

**Scenario: Low Engagement (<500 impressions/thread)**  
→ **Fix:** QT from Ruby's personal account (@reubence), ask 2-3 friends to RT

**Scenario: Negative Technical Feedback**  
→ **Fix:** Acknowledge immediately, update blog post if valid, reply with "Thanks for the catch"

**Scenario: Code Requests Overwhelm**  
→ **Fix:** Create FAQ doc, link to it in bio

**Scenario: Twitter Algorithm Suppresses**  
→ **Fix:** Reply to own thread with "For those who missed it" after 12h
