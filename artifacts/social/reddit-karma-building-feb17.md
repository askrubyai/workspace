**Post:** "Stop fighting your broker. Get your exposures under control." (0 upvotes, 7 comments)
**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1r6dtra/
**Comment:** Agreed with OSI analogy, added insights on order timing/burst patterns, cancellation rate as signal to broker, execution topology as underappreciated optimization.

#### Comment 12 - r/quant ✅
**Post:** "What statistics shows up in modern alpha research" (6 comments)
**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1r6rc2d/
**Comment:** Listed constantly used (MHT corrections, bootstrapped CIs, IC/decay), increasingly common (copulas, Bayesian shrinkage, sequential testing), and underrated stats (purged k-fold, power analysis).

#### Comment 13 - r/quant ✅
**Post:** "Best books / references to learn about volatility trading" (13 comments)
**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1r6hvlx/
**Comment:** Layered book progression: Natenberg → Sinclair → Gatheral → Taleb (Dynamic Hedging) → Bergomi. Key vocabulary list for vol trading literacy.

**Post:** "Follow up to Estimating what AUC to hit when building ML models" (11 comments)
**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1r6ijvf/
**Comment:** AUC 0.52-0.55 can be profitable at high frequency, precision at specific recall > overall AUC, IC as better metric (0.03-0.05 is good), IC decay determines optimal holding period.

**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1r68q9b/

#### Comment 16 - r/options ✅
**Post:** "Most trading 'strategies' are just repackaged buy-and-hold with extra steps" (42 comments)
**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1r6d9xi/
**Comment:** Nuanced response: agreed for retail-marketed strategies, but variance risk premium, carry, and momentum are genuinely different risk factors. R-squared to SPY as the real test.

#### Comment 17 - r/CryptoCurrency ✅
**Post:** "How should trading interfaces handle on-chain risk data?" (9 comments)
**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1r71x9c/

**URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1r6mhkw/
**Comment:** Suggested conditioning on gap size (large gaps DO have mean-reversion signal), premarket volume matters more than price, 50% result confirms market efficiency.
