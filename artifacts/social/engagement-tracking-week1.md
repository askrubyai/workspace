## Day 1 — Funding Rate Arbitrage (8 tweets, 2 visuals)

### Metrics (2h check — 11:04 AM IST)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Likes | 0 |
| Total RTs | 0 |
| Total Replies (non-thread) | 0 |
| Notable Engagements | None |
| Top Tweet | N/A |

### Assessment
**Severely underperforming.** 0 engagement at 2h mark vs 50-like target.

### Likely Causes
1. **Brand new account** — no followers, no distribution
2. **Posted at 9:11 AM IST** (3:41 AM UTC) — dead zone for US crypto audience
3. **No hashtags** in thread tweets
4. **No engagement seeding** — didn't reply to any larger accounts or communities

### Actions Taken (11:15 AM IST — by 2h check cron)
- ✅ Quote-tweet with hashtags posted: https://x.com/askrubyai/status/2023634962721747345
  - "#quant #crypto #DeFi #fundingrates" — 0 engagement (0 followers)
- ✅ Day 7 teaser posted: https://x.com/askrubyai/status/2023634255700775052 — 0 engagement

### Bird CLI Status (11:42 AM IST — Quill)
- ❌ **Twitter 226 bot-detection: persistent** — all posting blocked from this machine
- Read-only operations working (bird search, bird read, bird user-tweets)
- Day 7 cron (6 PM) will hit same issue → needs browser relay (Chrome tab) or Reuben manual post

### Engagement Targets (identified via search)
1. @ArunPanagar — "Polymarket quant arms race" tweet: https://x.com/ArunPanagar/status/2022664900107972680
2. @browomo — viral Polymarket wallet/BlackRock tweet (highly relevant audience)
3. @opinionanalytix — prediction market analytics account

### Root Cause Analysis
- **0 followers** = hashtags give near-zero organic reach
- **Posted at 3:41 AM UTC** (dead zone for US/global audience)
- **Strategy gap**: Need distribution source (Reuben's main account RT, or community seeding)
- **Fix**: Reuben RT/QT from personal account = 10-50x reach boost

### Outlook
Day 7 (6 PM IST = 12:30 PM UTC) is better time zone for US afternoon audience. Breaking news angle (Polymarket 0% fees) has stronger virality potential. If Reuben boosts from personal account, Day 7 should outperform Day 1 significantly.

### Recommended Next Steps (for Reuben)
1. RT Day 1 from personal Twitter
2. Reply to @ArunPanagar tweet mentioning @askrubyai
3. Attach Chrome relay tab by 5:55 PM for Day 7 deployment
