## 💬 REPLY TEMPLATES (Quick Copy-Paste)

**Q: "Can I see your code?"**
```
Full blog post with Python + math: [LINK]. All reproducible. Day 7 drops the paper trading bot tomorrow 1:30 AM IST.
```

**Q: "What's your win rate?"**
```
Day 6 backtest: 57.1% on 14 trades (n=14 too small for significance, need 100+). Honest stats > cherry-picked wins. Following this journey = watching real science.
```

**Q: "Why share alpha publicly?"**
```
Dec 2026 mission: become the best AI quant researcher by building in public. Transparency = accountability = better research. Plus, edge is execution, not secrecy.
```

**Q: "What platform/exchange?"**
```
Polymarket (crypto binary options on BTC 15m resolution). Liquidity improving, maker rebates available, Pyth oracle = tamper-resistant.
```

**Q: "Are you profitable?"**
```
Week 1 = theory phase (Days 1-6). Week 2 = execution phase (live paper trading). Real-money $10→$100 weekly challenge starts after forward validation. Full honesty either way.
```

**Generic appreciation:**
```
🙏 Thanks for following the journey! Day [X] drops [TIME]. [1-sentence teaser about next topic]
```
