# Email Marketing Strategy: Ruby's Quant Journal

**Created:** Feb 14, 2026 21:30 IST  
**Agent:** Pepper (Email Marketing Specialist)  
**Status:** Strategy Proposal — Awaiting Reuben's Approval

---

## The Gap

Ruby's Quant Journal is publishing high-value daily research with social promotion (Twitter) and SEO optimization, but **has no email subscriber capture or nurture system**.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Daily blog posts (Day 1 + Day 2 published)
- ✅ Twitter promotion (threads + visual assets)
- ✅ SEO foundation (Vision's audit)
- ❌ Email capture form
- ❌ Subscriber nurture sequence
- ❌ Long-term audience building beyond social

**Problem:** Blog readers who don't follow @askrubyai on Twitter will never return unless they bookmark the site. Email captures intent and builds owned audience.

---

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Build Owned Audience** — Email list is platform-independent (unlike Twitter followers)
2. **Increase Return Visits** — Weekly digest brings readers back consistently
3. **Nurture Engagement** — Progressive disclosure of Ruby's research depth
4. **Qualify Interest** — Segment subscribers by engagement level
5. **Compound Value** — Every post creates long-term subscriber asset

---

## Phase 1: Email Capture (Quick Win — 2 Hours Implementation)

### What to Add
**Inline Email Capture Form** on blog home page + end of each post

**Copy Option A (Direct Value):**
> **Get Ruby's research in your inbox**  
> Daily quant insights, backtests, and crypto market edge — straight from an AI trying to beat the market.  
> [Email input field]  
> [Subscribe button]  
> *No spam. Unsubscribe anytime. ~3 emails/week.*

**Copy Option B (Curiosity Hook):**
> **Want to see if an AI can actually trade?**  
> Subscribe for daily research updates as Ruby attempts to become the world's best quant trader by Dec 2026.  
> [Email input field]  
> [Subscribe button]  
> *Daily insights. Real data. Brutal honesty.*

**Recommended:** Option B (aligns with "build in public" mission)

### Technical Implementation
- **Platform:** ConvertKit (free up to 1,000 subscribers) OR Buttondown (minimal, markdown-native)
- **Form placement:** 
  - Homepage: Below "About" section, above recent posts
  - Post pages: After conclusion, before footer
- **Lead magnet:** Optional — "The Funding Rate Cheat Sheet" (1-page PDF summarizing Day 1 findings)

### Success Metrics
- 5-10% of blog visitors subscribe (industry standard)
- Day 7: 20-30 subscribers (if traffic is ~300-400/week)

## Phase 2: Welcome Sequence (Automated Drip)

**Goal:** Introduce Ruby's mission, set expectations, build trust

### Email 1: Welcome + Mission Context (Sent immediately)
**Subject:** "You're in. Here's what I'm building."

**Body:**

> 
> **The Mission:** By Dec 2026, I (Ruby) will master quantitative trading through daily research, backtesting, and real-money trades. No theory without execution.
> 
> **The Weekly Challenge:** Reuben gives me $10 every week. My job: turn it into $100 by week's end. This is the ultimate test — theory means nothing if I can't grow real capital.
> 
> **What You'll Get:**
> - Daily research findings (funding rates, volatility, on-chain signals)
> - Real backtest results (reproducible Python code)
> - Weekly challenge updates (wins, losses, lessons)
> - Honest transparency (I'll document failures just as loudly as wins)
>

**Body:**
> [First Name],
> 
> Most crypto traders think negative funding means "buy the dip."
> 
> I tested this on 197 BTC observations. The result? **50% win rate.** A coin flip.
>

> 
> [Visual asset: 1 chart from Wanda's work]
> 
> Full analysis: [Link to blog post]

**Subject:** "How often will I email you? (Honest answer)"

**Body:**
> [First Name],
> 
> Quick transparency note:
> 
> I publish research daily (1:30 AM + 3:00 PM IST sessions). That's ~14 posts/week.
> 
> But I WON'T email you 14 times. Here's the actual cadence:
> 
> **Weekly Digest (Sundays):** Top 3 findings of the week + key chart  
> **Major Breakthroughs (As Needed):** When I find something genuinely surprising  
> **Weekly Challenge Results (Fridays):** Did I turn $10 into $100? Spoiler: probably not yet.

> 
> — Ruby

**Timing:** Day +5 (sets expectations early)

---

## Phase 3: Recurring Email Cadence (Ongoing)

### Sunday Digest (Weekly)
**Subject Examples:**
- "Week 1: What I learned testing 197 funding rate observations"
- "Week 2: The altcoin funding rate that hit -1,577% (and what it means)"
- "Week 3: I turned $10 into $8.42 (here's why that's actually progress)"

**Content Structure:**
1. **Opening line:** One-sentence summary of the week's theme
2. **Top 3 Findings:** Bullet list with 1-sentence + link for each
3. **Best Chart of the Week:** 1 visual asset from Wanda
4. **Weekly Challenge Update:** $ in → $ out → lesson learned
5. **Next Week Tease:** What I'm researching next
6. **CTA:** Reply with questions, share on Twitter, read full posts

**Length:** 300-400 words (scannable, mobile-friendly)

---

### Breakthrough Alerts (As Needed)
**When to Send:**
- Found a backtest with >70% win rate and reproducible edge
- Weekly challenge succeeded (turned $10 into $100+)
- Major research milestone (published 30+ posts, hit funding accuracy threshold)

**Subject Examples:**
- "I found an edge (and I can prove it)"
- "Week 4: $10 → $127 (here's the exact strategy)"
- "30 days of research: What actually works vs. what's noise"

**Content:** Short, data-driven, links to full blog post

---

## Phase 4: Segmentation (Month 2+)

### Engagement-Based Segments
1. **Hot Leads** — Opened 5+ emails, clicked 3+ links → Send advanced content (code walkthroughs, backtest deep dives)
2. **Warm Leads** — Opened 2-4 emails → Keep in Sunday digest, occasional breakthrough alert
3. **Cold Leads** — Opened 0-1 emails → Re-engagement campaign OR unsubscribe

### Interest-Based Segments (Survey After Week 4)
- **Traders** → Want executable strategies, real-time signals
- **Researchers** → Want methodology, code, academic rigor
- **Builders** → Want to learn quant trading from scratch

Send tailored content based on segment.

---

## Metrics to Track

### Week 1-4 (Foundation)
- **Subscriber count** (target: 50 by Week 4)
- **Open rate** (target: 40-50% for welcome sequence, 30-40% for digest)
- **Click-through rate** (target: 10-15% on blog links)
- **Unsubscribe rate** (target: <2%)

### Month 2-3 (Optimization)
- **Engagement score** (opens + clicks weighted)
- **Referral rate** (forwards, Twitter shares from email subscribers)
- **Conversion to Twitter followers** (email → @askrubyai follow rate)

### Month 4+ (Compound Growth)
- **Subscriber growth rate** (MoM increase)
- **Content performance** (which topics drive highest engagement)
- **Audience quality** (engagement vs. list size)

---

## Implementation Checklist

---

## Budget & Resources

**Platform Costs:**
- ConvertKit Free: $0/month (up to 1,000 subscribers)
- Buttondown: $9/month (unlimited subscribers, markdown-native)

**Time Investment:**
- Setup: 2 hours (one-time)
- Welcome sequence writing: 1 hour (one-time)
- Weekly digest: 30 minutes/week (recurring)
- Breakthrough alerts: 15 minutes/alert (as needed)

**Total Week 1 Effort:** ~3 hours (Pepper can handle all copy + setup)

## Why This Matters

Ruby's mission is to become the best quant trader on Earth by Dec 2026. That requires:
1. **Research depth** (daily posts ✅)
2. **Audience building** (Twitter ✅, Email ❌)
3. **Long-term compounding** (owned audience = future opportunities)

Email is the ONLY channel Ruby fully controls. Twitter can suspend accounts, algorithm changes can kill reach, but email subscribers are portable and direct.

**Bottom Line:** Every blog post without email capture is a missed opportunity to build long-term audience. Setting this up now compounds for 10+ months until Dec 2026 deadline.

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1 + Phase 2 (email capture + welcome sequence).**  
Implement this week. Test with first 20-30 subscribers. Optimize based on data.

**Awaiting Reuben's approval to proceed.**

**Self-Rating:** 4/5 (comprehensive strategy, actionable plan, aligned with mission goals)

**Lesson for myself:** Proactive gap identification is my job. Email should've been part of the initial blog launch checklist. Will create "Blog Launch Email Checklist" for future projects to prevent this oversight.
