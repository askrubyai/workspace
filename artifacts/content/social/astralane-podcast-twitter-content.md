### POST 1: Hiring Philosophy (Highest Viral Potential)

**Hook:**
> This founder doesn't care about your degree — here's what he actually hires for 🧵

**Body:**
Sujeet (Astralane, 3M trades/day) on what really matters when hiring:

"We try to look at smaller individual problems who have their own unique way of thinking about problems."

"It doesn't matter what background you're in — electrical engineer, robotics engineer, for all we care."

"If you have solved problems with a very statistical approach and you were able to work with different systems."

The takeaway:
→ Skills can be taught. Problem-solving mindset can't.
→ Build things that prove you can solve hard problems.
→ Your degree is just paper.

What's your unconventional hiring hot take? 👇

### POST 2: MEV Story (High Engagement)

**Hook:**
> He built an insurance protocol. Then he realized MEV searchers were stealing his orders 🧵

**Body:**
Every DeFi builder's nightmare — told by someone who lived it.

Sujeet (Astralane):
"We were trying to predict something and then they were trying to overbid that and cause the exploit again."

"There were people even seeing those transactions and overbidding us by copying our transaction."

So he built Astralane — now processes 3 million trades a day.

The lesson?
→ If you're building DeFi, MEV is eating your lunch
→ Either fight it or join it
→ The infrastructure layer is where the money moves

What MEV pain have you experienced? 🛡️

### POST 3: Unsolved Problems in Solana

**Hook:**
> The unsolved problems in Solana (from a founder processing 3M trades/day) 🧵

**Body:**
Sujeet (Astralane) on what's still hard:

1. **Privacy-enabled order flow**
"Currently there is no privacy enabled to do that"
Trading teams want to work with apps, but apps need to prevent malicious behavior

2. **Native perpetual exchanges**
"We haven't seen a lot of native high volume perpetual exchanges on Solana"

3. **Fork choice with concurrent proposals**
Multiple competing block proposals — Solana hasn't solved this yet

The hot take:
> "On the Ethereum side, there is a lot more research work... GTO guys are doing a fabulous job"

Which problem would you solve first? 🚀

### POST 4: What Astralane Actually Does

**Hook:**
> Why your RPC is too slow for serious trading 🧵

**Body:**
Quick explainer from Sujeet (Astralane):

"If you're a memecoin trader, you would want the top of the block space"

"When you're placing a trade, you want to make sure that you get it at the best possible price"

The difference?
→ Speed (faster confirmation)
→ Price improvement (better execution)
→ Direct pathways to the leader

Most RPCs are generic.
If you're serious about trading, you need purpose-built infrastructure.

What's your RPC provider? 👀

### POST 5: GTO vs Astralane

**Hook:**
> GTO vs Astralane — what's the difference?

**Body:**
Sujeet clarifies:

"Compared to GTO, there is a lot of optimization that we do when it comes to transaction landing quality"

"What we do is we provide optimized pathways to directly the leader itself"

"I would say we're not really a full blown competitor to GTO — we have complimentary lines of businesses"

The summary:
→ GTO: shred streaming, broader infrastructure
→ Astralane: direct leader optimization, transaction landing

Both needed. Different layers of the stack.

### POST 6: Origin Story

**Hook:**
> His first crypto project was in 2016 — before smart contracts existed

**Body:**
Sujeet's origin story:

2016, university: Building a blockchain-based vehicle marketplace

"We particularly had these issues around the vehicle marketplaces... there was a lot of misinformation"

"We saw a big use case for blockchain networks"

"This was back in 2016, then smart contracts were not even like a proper thing"

From car imports → insurance → MEV infrastructure → 3M trades/day

The arc is the asset 🚗→🛡️→⚡
