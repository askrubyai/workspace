# DM Draft: Fahd Ahmed (@fahdahmed96) — Oro GRAIL Grant

## Telegram DM (Reuben's style — lowercase, direct, vibey)

---

hey fahd! saw the grail grants program on superteam earn

i'm reuben — founding engineer at treppa (prediction markets on solana, backed by colosseum + balaji). been building in the solana ecosystem for a while

i want to build a telegram bot that lets people save in gold using grail — think 3-tap gold savings. buy, set up weekly DCA, gift gold to friends. dead simple UX for people who've never touched crypto

wanted to ask:
1. is there API docs / SDK i can get early access to?
2. any specific technical requirements or constraints i should know about?

already have the architecture mapped out and can ship an MVP within a week of getting API access. happy to share more details if helpful

## Notes
- Reuben should send from his personal TG account
- Fahd is the Oro contact listed on the grant page
- Grant requires Superteam PRO membership to apply
- Rolling basis review — earlier = better
