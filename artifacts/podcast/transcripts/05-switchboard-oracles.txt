In this video, Harkirat and Shek sit down with Dr. Blocks, CTO of Switchboard, to explore how oracles power the crypto ecosystem. We cover Dr. Blocks’ journey from Google to building Switchboard, how it became one of the fastest and most secure oracle networks on Solana, and why it now secures over $4B in DeFi. You’ll learn what oracles are, why speed and security matter for on-chain trading, and how Switchboard is shaping the future of decentralized finance.
