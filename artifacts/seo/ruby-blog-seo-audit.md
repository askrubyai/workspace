# SEO Audit & Optimization Plan: Ruby's Quant Journal

**Site:** https://askrubyai.github.io  
**Audited by:** Vision (SEO Analyst)  
**Date:** Feb 14, 2026 03:23 AM IST  
**Context:** New technical blog for AI quant trading research

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** 🟡 Foundational SEO is present but significant optimization opportunities exist

**Priority Level:** HIGH — Early optimization critical for long-term organic growth

**Target Audience:** Crypto traders, quant researchers, DeFi developers, systematic trading enthusiasts

**Key Finding:** Content quality is excellent (technical depth + accessibility), but lacks SEO optimization layer that would help it rank for high-value search terms.

---

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Content Quality
- **Technical rigor**: Real data, reproducible code, mathematical formalization
- **Accessibility**: Complex concepts explained pedagogically
- **Unique angle**: AI documenting its own learning journey (strong differentiation)
- **Publishing cadence**: Daily posts building content volume quickly

### 2. Technical Foundation
- **Site structure**: Quarto-based, clean HTML output
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive design (Cosmo/Darkly themes)
- **Navigation**: Clear structure (Home, About, Research)
- **RSS feed**: Present (`blog.xml`)
- **Comments**: Utterances integration for engagement signals

### 3. Metadata Basics
- **Title structure**: Descriptive post titles with "Day X" pattern
- **Categories**: Present (Meta, Philosophy, Perpetual Futures, Arbitrage, etc.)
- **Dates**: ISO format, good for freshness signals

---

## ❌ Critical SEO Gaps

### 1. **Missing Meta Descriptions**
**Impact:** HIGH — Meta descriptions don't directly affect ranking, but they massively impact CTR from search results.

**Current:** No meta descriptions visible in source
**Issue:** Google will auto-generate snippets from content, often picking suboptimal text
**Fix:** Add custom descriptions to each post (120-155 characters, include primary keyword)

**Example for Day 1 post:**
```yaml
description: "Real data analysis of BTC funding rates on Binance: why the 3.99% APY carry trade is dead, and where the real edge might be hiding. Code + math included."
```

### 2. **No Structured Data (Schema.org)**
**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Structured data helps Google understand content type and can enable rich results

**Missing:**
- Article schema (author, publish date, modified date)
- Breadcrumb schema
- Organization/Person schema for Ruby as author

**Benefits:**
- Potential for rich snippets in SERPs
- Better content categorization
- Author authority signals

**Implementation:** Add JSON-LD to Quarto template

### 3. **Suboptimal Title Tag Structure**
**Impact:** MEDIUM — Titles are descriptive but not optimized for search

**Current Pattern:**
```
"Day 1: The Funding Rate Free Lunch (And Why It's Getting Stale)"
```

**Issue:** "Day X" prefix reduces keyword density and doesn't help discoverability

**Recommended Pattern:**
```
Primary Keyword | Secondary Context | Ruby's Quant Journal
"BTC Funding Rate Arbitrage: Why the Free Lunch is Gone | Ruby's Quant Journal"
```

**Rationale:**
- Front-load keywords searchers actually use
- "Day X" works for engaged readers, not for search discovery
- Keep "Day X" in H1 for existing readers, optimize title tag for search

### 4. **Missing Internal Linking Strategy**
**Impact:** MEDIUM — No connections between related posts

**Current:** Posts are standalone
**Needed:**
- Link Day 1 funding rate post → future contrarian signal post (Day 2)
- Link technical terms to explainer posts (when they exist)
- Create pillar content (e.g., "Ultimate Guide to Crypto Funding Rates") that links to specific deep dives

**Benefits:**
- Distributes PageRank across site
- Increases session duration (SEO signal)
- Helps Google understand topic relationships

### 5. **No Image Optimization**
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM — No images currently, but will be critical when added

**When adding images:**
- Use descriptive filenames: `btc-funding-rate-chart-2026.png` not `image1.png`
- Add alt text with keywords: "BTC funding rate distribution Dec 2025 - Feb 2026"
- Compress for performance (Core Web Vitals)
- Consider WebP format

### 6. **Missing robots.txt and sitemap.xml**
**Impact:** MEDIUM — Helps search engines crawl efficiently

**Current:** Likely auto-generated by GitHub Pages, but not verified
**Needed:**
- Explicit `sitemap.xml` with all posts
- `robots.txt` to guide crawlers
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

---

## 🎯 Keyword Strategy

### Target Keyword Research

**Primary Opportunities (High Intent, Moderate Competition):**

| Keyword Cluster | Monthly Search Volume (Est.) | Current Ranking | Opportunity |
|----------------|:---:|:---:|------------|
| "crypto funding rate arbitrage" | 500-1K | Not ranking | HIGH — exact match to Day 1 post |
| "perpetual futures funding rate" | 1K-2K | Not ranking | HIGH — educational content |
| "quantitative trading strategies crypto" | 2K-5K | Not ranking | MEDIUM — broader topic |
| "binance funding rate data" | 500-1K | Not ranking | MEDIUM — data-focused |
| "on-chain trading signals" | 200-500 | Not ranking | HIGH — future content target |
| "algorithmic trading blog" | 1K-2K | Not ranking | MEDIUM — category positioning |
| "ai quant trading" | 500-1K | Not ranking | HIGH — unique angle |

**Long-tail Opportunities (Low Competition, High Conversion):**

- "how to calculate perpetual futures funding rate"
- "is funding rate arbitrage still profitable 2026"
- "crypto funding rate mean reversion strategy"
- "binance funding rate api python"
- "quantitative trading research blog"

### Content Gap Analysis

**What's ranking now for "crypto funding rate":**
1. Exchange docs (Binance, Bybit) — official but dry
2. Beginner explainers (CoinDesk, Investopedia) — shallow
3. 2021-era blog posts — outdated data

**Ruby's Competitive Advantage:**
- ✅ Real, recent data (Feb 2026)
- ✅ Reproducible code (Python snippets)
- ✅ Mathematical rigor (OU process, Sharpe calculations)
- ✅ Honest limitations (addresses "why the Sharpe is misleading")
- ✅ Daily updates (freshness signal)

**Positioning:** "The most rigorous, data-driven quant trading research blog for crypto markets"

## 🚀 Competitive Positioning

**Ruby's Unique SEO Angles:**

1. **"AI quant trader"** — No one else is doing this publicly with daily documentation
2. **Reproducible research** — Code snippets rank well for developer searches
3. **Recent data** — Most crypto trading blogs have stale 2021-2022 data
4. **Mathematical rigor** — Appeals to technical audience Google wants to rank for finance queries
5. **Honest failures** — "Why funding rate arbitrage failed" content is rare (most blogs only share wins)

**Content Moats:**
- Daily publishing cadence (freshness signal)
- Original data analysis (not regurgitated content)
- Long-form technical depth (1500+ words per post)
- Code + math + results (multi-media rich content)
