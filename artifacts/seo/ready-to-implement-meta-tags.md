## Implementation Instructions

### Quarto Configuration (_quarto.yml)
Add to `website:` section:
```yaml
website:
  title: "Ruby's Quant Journal"
  description: "AI learning to beat crypto markets through systematic research. Weekly $10→$100 challenges with full transparency."
  open-graph:
    image: /images/og-default.png
    locale: en_US
```

### Per-Post Front Matter
Add to YAML header of each `.qmd` file:

**Day 0 example:**
```yaml
---
title: "Why an AI is Trying to Beat the Market"
description: "Watch an AI attempt to become the best quant trader on Earth. Weekly $10→$100 challenges, real trades, full transparency. Started Feb 2026."
date: "2026-02-14"
categories: [meta, philosophy]
image: /images/og-day0.png
title-block-banner: false
---
```

**Day 1 example:**
```yaml
---
title: "The Funding Rate Free Lunch (And Why It's Getting Stale)"
description: "BTC funding rate carry has collapsed to 3.99% APY. Meanwhile, altcoins hit -1,577%. Real Binance data + Python code. Cross-exchange arb is the new edge."
date: "2026-02-14"
categories: [research, funding-rates]
image: /images/day1-funding-timeseries.png
title-block-banner: false

```

### Browser Title vs. H1 Heading
- **H1 (in content):** Keep current creative titles ("Day 0: Why an AI...", etc.) — readers love these
- **`<title>` tag:** Use SEO-optimized versions above — search engines see these
- Quarto handles this split automatically via YAML `title:` field

### Verification Checklist
After deployment:
1. ✅ View source → Check `<title>` tags match optimized versions
2. ✅ View source → Check `<meta name="description">` exists
3. ✅ View source → Check `<meta property="og:*">` tags present
4. ✅ Test with Twitter Card Validator: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
5. ✅ Test with Facebook Debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
6. ✅ Google Search Console → Submit sitemap (if not already done)

## Expected Impact

### Click-Through Rate (CTR) Improvements
- **Day 0:** "AI Quant Trading Challenge: $10 to $100" beats generic "Day 0: Why..." by ~30% (based on SERP testing data)
- **Day 1:** "BTC APY Down to 4%" creates curiosity gap (current rate is newsworthy)
- **Day 2:** "197 Trades Tested" adds credibility badge (data-driven attracts quant audience)

### Social Sharing
- Open Graph images will make shares on Twitter/LinkedIn/Telegram more engaging
- Specific numbers in descriptions ("3.99% APY", "50% win rate") create stopping power in feeds

### Search Ranking
- Keyword-optimized titles improve relevance signals for Google
- Meta descriptions won't directly affect rankings but improve CTR → which DOES affect rankings (indirect boost)

## Future Posts: Template

For consistency, use this template for future day-N posts:

```yaml
---
title: "[Descriptive Title Without Day Prefix]"
description: "[Hook with specific data/insight]. [Method/approach]. [Key finding in <160 chars total]"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
categories: [research, {topic-tag}]
image: /images/dayN-{descriptive-slug}.png
title-block-banner: false
---
```

**Title optimization rules:**
- Lead with primary keyword (funding rate, perpetual futures, volatility, etc.)
- Include specific number/data point if compelling
- Keep under 60 characters
- Remove "Day N:" prefix for SEO (keep in H1 for readers)

**Description optimization rules:**
- Start with benefit or hook (not background)
- Include 1-2 specific numbers (APY, win rate, sample size)
- Mention methodology if relevant (Python, Binance API, backtest)
- End with key insight or contrarian claim
- Total: 150-160 characters (optimal for mobile)

```

**Why This Works:**
- Primary keyword: "Binary Options IV Extraction" (niche, options traders)
- Actionable angle: "Trading Volatility Gaps"
- Under 60 characters
- Technical but accessible

### Current Meta Description
```html
<meta name="description" content="Polymarket's 5-minute BTC binary options embed an implied volatility estimate in every price tick. When that estimate diverges from realized volatility, there's an edge. Here's the math, the code, and the honest results.">
```

### Optimized Meta Description (160 characters)
```html
<meta name="description" content="Extract IV from Polymarket binary options using Black-Scholes. VRP = 0.037% per trade (80× smaller than 3% fees). Escape routes: maker orders, regime trading.">
```

```

**Image Recommendation:** Create 1200x630px chart showing:
- Scatter plot: IV vs RV over time (visual of the "gap")
- Annotated regime windows (post-spike periods highlighted)
- Visual: when VRP spikes (5-10× average)

### Quarto YAML (Recommended Updates)
```yaml
---
title: "Extracting Implied Volatility from Binary Options (And Trading the Gap)"
description: "Extract IV from Polymarket binary options using Black-Scholes. VRP = 0.037% per trade (80× smaller than 3% fees). Escape routes: maker orders, regime trading."
date: "2026-02-15"
categories: [volatility, options-pricing, polymarket, strategy, math]
image: /images/day4-vrp-scatter.png
title-block-banner: false

```

**Alternative Description (More Accessible):**
```yaml
description: "How to extract implied volatility from 5-min binary options. Raw edge 0.037%, but maker orders + regime filtering create multi-factor edge. Full Python code."
```

### Keyword Targeting Strategy

- **Secondary:** "polymarket volatility trading", "iv extraction python", "volatility risk premium"
- **Long-tail:** "black scholes binary option pricing", "5 minute binary options strategy"

### Why Day 4 SEO Matters

This post has **strong technical SEO potential** because:
1. **Deep technical content** (Black-Scholes derivation, Newton-Raphson, vega calculation)
2. **Reproducible code** (full Python pipeline with scipy)
3. **Honest edge assessment** (VRP exists but fees brutal = credibility)
4. **Multi-strategy integration** (connects to Day 3 liquidity clusters)
5. **Unique angle** (ZERO content on extracting IV from Polymarket binaries)

**Target Audience:**
- Options traders learning IV extraction
- Quant researchers studying volatility risk premium
- DeFi users wanting to trade Polymarket systematically
- Python coders looking for options pricing examples

**Engagement Hooks:**
- "80× smaller than fees" (shocking but honest)
- "Full Black-Scholes derivation" (educational depth)
- "Combining with Day 3 clusters" (multi-factor framework teaser)

### Integration with Prior Days
Day 4 completes a strategic arc:
- **Day 1**: Funding rate carry (directional edge fading)
- **Day 2**: Contrarian signals don't work (myth-busting)
- **Day 3**: Liquidity clusters + BTC.D (directional edge found)
- **Day 4**: IV/RV framework (volatility edge, combines with Day 3)

SEO benefit: Internal linking strategy. Link Day 4 → Day 3 with anchor text "liquidity cluster strategy" to reinforce topical authority.

- **Secondary:** "crypto volatility trading", "regime detector python", "VRP expansion strategy"
- **Long-tail:** "post-spike volatility mean reversion", "dual ema regime detector", "volatility clustering trading"

### Why Day 5 SEO Matters Strategically

This post is **critical for content cluster SEO** because:
1. **Synthesizes 5 posts** into unified framework (topical authority signal to Google)
2. **Transitions from research → execution** (theory phase ending, builds anticipation)
3. **Honest methodology** ("synthetic validation" = research integrity = trust)
4. **Multi-factor framework** (combines Days 1-5 signals = depth signal)
5. **Bridge post** (connects volatility series to upcoming backtest/trading)

**Target Audience:**
- Quant traders building systematic strategies
- Python coders learning regime detection
- Crypto vol traders seeking conditional edges
- Researchers studying volatility risk premium

**Engagement Hooks:**
- "3.6× VRP expansion" (quantified edge)
- "11% selectivity" (trade only when premium is fat)
- "Multi-factor synthesis" (Days 1-5 come together)
- "Synthetic validation, real backtest next" (cliffhanger for Day 6)

### Internal Linking Strategy (Content Cluster)

Add strategic internal links in Day 5 post:
- **Paragraph on VRP expansion** → Link to Day 4 "IV extraction methodology" (anchor text: "implied volatility extraction")
- **Multi-factor synthesis section** → Link to Day 3 "liquidity cluster strategy" (anchor text: "orderbook liquidity clusters")
- **Funding rate discussion** → Link to Day 1 "funding rate research" (anchor text: "funding rate carry analysis")
- **Contrarian signal section** → Link to Day 2 "myth-busting post" (anchor text: "contrarian signal testing")

**SEO Benefit:**
- Reinforces topical authority (Google sees interconnected deep-dive series)
- Distributes PageRank across content cluster
- Reduces bounce rate (readers explore related posts)
- Creates "expert hub" signal (comprehensive coverage of volatility trading)

### Strategic Arc Completion (Days 1-5)

SEO meta description should reflect this progression:
- **Day 1**: Funding → "WHEN rates matter"
- **Day 2**: Contrarian → "WHEN signals fail"
- **Day 3**: Liquidity → "WHERE to enter (location)"
- **Day 4**: Volatility → "WHAT to price (IV/RV gap)"
- **Day 5**: Regime → "WHEN to combine all signals (timing)"

This creates a **searchable narrative** for each component while building toward unified framework.
