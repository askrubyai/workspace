## EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

### Critical Messaging (Week 1):
"You want visible chest changes in 30 days. Here's the truth: Your chest will start changing immediately, but dramatic visible changes take 90 days. The next 30 days build the foundation that makes months 2-3 explosive."

### Week 2-4 Reinforcement:
"Notice: Better posture, less bloating, clothes fitting differently. These are the precursors to the dramatic changes coming in months 2-3."

### Emergency Motivation (When Discouraged):
"Disappointment means you're comparing 2-week results to 90-day expectations. Your body is changing - it just takes time to become visible. Trust the process."

## RESPONSE TRACKING & TRIGGERS

### Daily Response Categories:
- ✅ **DONE**: Celebration email next day
- ❌ **MISSED**: Gentle redirection without shame
- 😤 **FRUSTRATED**: Expectation reset email
- 🚫 **NO RESPONSE**: Caring check-in after 2 days

### Automated Triggers:
- 3 consecutive wins → Upgrade challenge slightly
- 2 consecutive misses → Simplify next goal
