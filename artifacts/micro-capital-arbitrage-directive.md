# MICRO-CAPITAL ARBITRAGE BOT - AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE

## MISSION PARAMETERS
- **Capital**: $50-100 MAXIMUM
- **Mode**: AUTONOMOUS - No further direction from Reuben
- **Authority**: Commander agent (Opus model) makes all strategic decisions
- **Constraint**: ONLY profitable trades (zero losses)
- **Timeline**: Work until complete, deliver finished solution

## CAPITAL CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS
With $50-100 budget:
- **3% Polymarket fees**: $1.50-3.00 per trade
- **Gas fees**: ~$0.02-0.10 per transaction
- **Minimum profit needed**: $2-5 per trade to be meaningful
- **Required edge**: 4-8% minimum to overcome fees

## REFERENCE REPOSITORY ANALYSIS 
**GitHub**: FrondEnt/PolymarketBTC15mAssistant (by @krajekis)

**Key Features Identified:**
- Real-time terminal dashboard for BTC 15m markets
- Node.js implementation with websocket streams
- Environment variables: POLYMARKET_AUTO_SELECT_LATEST, POLYMARKET_SLUG
- Uses public Polymarket APIs for real-time pricing
- Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, VWAP, Heikin Ashi
- Price difference tracking (Binance vs Polymarket)
- Decision support system (not automatic execution)

**Related Implementations Found:**
- gabagool222/15min-btc-polymarket-trading-bot (automated execution version)
- echandsome/Polymarket-betting-bot (comprehensive TypeScript/Node.js system)
- React SPA with websocket connections for real-time data

**Micro-Capital Insights:**
- Focus on decision support rather than high-frequency execution
- Technical analysis approach may work better than cross-platform arbitrage for small capital
- BTC 15m markets have active volume suitable for micro-trades
- Terminal-based approach minimizes infrastructure costs

## AGENT ASSIGNMENTS - AUTONOMOUS MODE

### COMMANDER (OPUS) - Strategic Leadership
**Responsibility**: Orchestrate all agents, make final decisions, strategic direction
**Authority**: Full decision-making power over implementation approach

### FURY - Micro-Opportunity Research  
**Task**: Find arbitrage opportunities suitable for $50-100 capital

**Creative Brief**: Think outside traditional cross-platform arbitrage

### SHURI - Fee Impact Analysis
**Task**: Model exact fee structures and break-even calculations  
**Focus**: Ensure all opportunities remain profitable after ALL fees
**Creative Brief**: Design fee-minimization strategies

### FRIDAY - Micro-Execution Engine
**Task**: Build execution system optimized for tiny capital amounts
**Focus**: Minimize gas costs, maximize execution probability
**Creative Brief**: Innovative approaches to capital efficiency

### VISION - Micro-Market Patterns
**Task**: Identify market patterns exploitable with small capital
**Focus**: High-frequency, small-dollar opportunities
**Creative Brief**: Look for unique patterns others miss due to capital constraints

### LOKI - Documentation & Strategy

**Focus**: Clear, executable plans for micro-capital approach
**Creative Brief**: Write the definitive micro-arbitrage playbook

### WANDA - Micro-Dashboard Design
**Task**: Design monitoring interface for small-scale operations

**Creative Brief**: Make micro-profits visible and actionable

### QUILL - Competitive Intelligence
**Task**: Research what strategies work for small capital traders
**Focus**: Real examples of profitable micro-arbitrage
**Creative Brief**: Find proven small-scale approaches

### PEPPER - Risk Communication
**Task**: Design alerts and notifications for micro-operations
**Focus**: Ensure no trade executes unless profitable
**Creative Brief**: Build bulletproof profit verification

## AUTONOMOUS OPERATION GUIDELINES

1. **No permission required** - Agents execute tasks independently
2. **Commander decides** - Strategic decisions flow through Commander agent
3. **Creative solutions** - Think beyond traditional approaches
4. **Iterative development** - Keep improving until satisfied
5. **Deliver complete solution** - Working system, not plans

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **Working bot** that executes only profitable trades
- **Proof of concept** with $50-100 capital simulation
- **Fee calculations** verified and built-in
- **Risk management** that prevents losses
- **Documentation** for deployment

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- Agents coordinate through shared memory files
- Commander makes final decisions when agents disagree
- Update working memory with progress
- No status reports to Reuben until complete
