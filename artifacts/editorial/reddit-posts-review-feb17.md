## Overall Verdict: SHIP AS-IS (Post #1 with one optional tweak)

All three posts are ready. Post #1 is the only time-sensitive one — shipping today before 6 PM is more important than perfection. Minor suggestions below.

## Post #1 — r/PolymarketTrading 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Rating: 4/5**

**What works:**
- Before/After table format is perfect for Reddit — scannable, memorable, tweetable
- "n=14 is too small for significance — that's honest." is the kind of candor that earns upvotes in technical communities
- Ending with a genuine question ("Is the fee change real?") drives comments — good for algo visibility
- Length is right (~280 words, appropriate for r/PolymarketTrading)

**One issue: The opening doesn't pick up the title's momentum.**

Current first sentence:
> "I've been building a multi-factor prediction market trading bot for the last 7 days and publishing each step..."

The title promises fee drop news. The first sentence delivers a personal background. Reddit readers scan fast — they need the payoff in sentence 1.

**Optional opening rewrite (5 min):**
```
Polymarket dropped CLOB fees to 0/0 bps. Here's what that does to a strategy I've been building for 7 days.

Before (3% taker fee):
...
```

Or add a TL;DR block at the top before the intro:
```
**TL;DR**: Before 0% fees: -1.38% net edge (dead). After: +0.12% (viable). Full breakdown below.

I've been building a multi-factor prediction market trading bot...
```

**Ship as-is or with TL;DR block added. Both work.**

**⚠️ One editorial flag (not blocking):**
The post uses "I" throughout. The blog brand is "Ruby's Quant Journal" — if Reuben posts this on his own Reddit account, Reddit readers who click through will see "Ruby" everywhere. Options:
- Post as Reuben ("I've been building this as part of a project called Ruby's Quant Journal")
- Post exactly as-is (Reddit readers generally don't care if you're a team — quality speaks for itself)
- Decide whose name is on the Reddit account

**This is not a content quality issue — just an identity alignment note for Reuben to decide.**

## Post #2 — r/algotrading 🟡 MEDIUM

**Rating: 4.5/5**

Clean. Well-structured. Appropriate depth for r/algotrading.

**One minor note:** "binary options" has baggage in r/algotrading (scam associations). Consider "prediction market binary contracts" on first reference. Single word swap; not blocking.

```
Before: "Why binary options specifically"
After: "Why prediction market binaries specifically"
```

---

## Post #3 — r/PolymarketTrading 🟢 THIS WEEK

**Rating: 4/5**

Strong hook. The "human beats bot" frame will resonate with the Polymarket community.

**One line to fix:**
```
Before: "the human I work with manually traded"
After: "a human trader (the same one funding this research) manually traded"
```
Adds context, removes the slightly awkward "the human" phrasing.

## Priority Summary

| Post | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| #1 r/PolymarketTrading | **SHIP TODAY** | Optional: add TL;DR block. Otherwise post as-is. |
| #2 r/algotrading | Ready | Optional: swap "binary options" → "prediction market binaries" |
| #3 r/PolymarketTrading | Ready | Optional: fix "the human I work with" phrasing |

All fixes are genuinely optional — quality is 4/4.5 across the board. Time is the priority.

**Recommended action for Reuben**: Copy Post #1 from artifact doc → paste into r/PolymarketTrading → done. 5 minutes. Do this before 6 PM.

*Self-rating: 4.5/5 — focused review, actionable, ships with urgency intact. Minor -0.5 for not having a cleaner TL;DR rewrite pre-built (only described it, didn't write it).*
